Materials are at the foundation for all of engineering, as evident by the latest products that we design, to the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smartphones. In fact, breakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid advancements in technology. Thus, it is paramount for all engineers to have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In this class, we focus on the structure of materials, the microstructure connection to mechanical properties, and, ultimately, failure mechanisms.  Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, which will be addressed in the context of components and extreme environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, defect formation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms. Material anisotropy, micromechanisms, and elastoplastic properties at the atomic, single-crystal/constituent, and polycrystal-material levels and their use in explaining the deformation and failure characteristics in metals, polymers, and ceramics; failure mechanisms and toughening in composites; structure and behavior of aerospace materials: metal alloys, ceramic-matrix composites, and fiberreinforced polymer composites. Particular topics will also include: elastic deformation, dislocation mechanics, plastic deformation and strengthening mechanisms, creep, and failure mechanisms; design criteria; special topics. We will attempt to have minimal overlap with AAE 55400, Fatigue of Structures and Materials.  Therefore we will not cover fracture, fatigue, or stress concentrators. **Credits:** 3.00"

    "description": "The usage of materials is the backbone of engineering practice. Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals. Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries. The course will be comprised of three projects, where the student chooses the topic of the third and final project. Prerequisite: AAE 55300 or equivalent.  3.00"

Science and technology are evolving faster than societies ability to understand, assimilate, and make policies to address these increasingly complex issues. As a result, controversies arise over issues such as climate change, forest management, genetically modified foods, energy choices, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, water management, and agricultural practices, etc. This course covers the range of issues in the field of science communication including: the nature of science, how to translate evidence for a lay audience, media practices, reporting and qualifying uncertainty, human psychology and belief systems, information processing, and the most current research for messaging science. We will work together to examine the foundational scholarly literature in this area and how it is/ or is not reflected in construction of popular media. You will use this knowledge to construct both compelling oral science narratives, and a science story for popular consumption.  3.00"

How did ancient societies adapt in the face of social conflict and environmental challenges? What lessons can we learn from resilience or collapse of states in the ancient past? This course compares the political, social, ecological, contexts of the rise and fall of early complex societies, from densely populated hunter-gatherers in North America to the world's major ancient civilizations in Mesoamerica, the Andes, Nile Valley, Mesopotamia, Indus Valley, and China. We will also explore how societies responded to 'grand challenges' in antiquity such as climate variability, food insecurity, global-intercultural interaction, and what modern lessons we might derive from their successes and failures. **Credits:** 3.00"

    "description": "This course provides a hands-on experience for life science researchers in the bioinformatic analysis of genome-scale data. The various disciplines in the life sciences are generating a wealth of experimental and annotation data. Today's graduate students need experience with modern tools that can help them to access, explore, analyze, interpret and manage the data that they generate in the lab. Students will use the R programming language and packages from Bioconductor, the R bioinformatics project, as their principal tools for this course. Students will develop workflows in R that bridge established algorithms for bioinformatics such as limma, edgeR or DESeq2, incorporating methods to import, QC, transform and visualize genome-scale datasets derived from next generation sequencing experiments. A critical aspect of bioinformatics that is often inadequate is workflow documentation. This course will use Rmarkdown to integrate computer code, data and results to manage complex bioinformatics projects. The class has lecture, lab and distance components. Lectures will focus on the theoretical and biological aspects of bioinformatics analysis using recent examples from the literature. In lab, students will work on programming exercises or projects using published datasets. Advanced students will also have the opportunity to work with their own data. Distance instruction will include R tutorials and videos that students can work through at their own pace (subject to completion deadlines). Particular emphasis will be placed on the theoretical and practical limitations of next generation sequencing data. No prior computer programming experience is required, but it is assumed that students have a firm grasp of the fundamental principles of molecular biology and how they relate to complex processes such as gene expression and genome organization.

Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences - mostly because it touches on all areas of study. The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College of Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind? What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications. In most cases, there is no one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical considerations. **Credits:** 3.00"

We will see how achieving scientific understanding is a dynamic process. The COVID-19 scientific literature will be dissected with a focus on publication ethics. Students will each make an oral presentation and write an essay on a relevant topic thereby allowing them to fulfill graduation requirements. These assignments will require the demonstration of the capacity to report data, organize the material, and convey it using formal English.

The emphasis of this first section will be on the general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative detail our current understanding of select important human viruses including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumorcausing viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution. Throughout the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral bioterror of bioerror. **Credits:** 3.00"

Many plant pathogens and diseases have increased their geographic distribution and intensity in the U.S. and the world. A lack of epidemiological understanding can exacerbate problems and significantly challenge the management of diseases at the field level. This course is an introduction to the epidemiological basis of disease management strategies. The course includes concepts in botanical epidemiology, disease assessment and measurement, disease modeling, epidemics comparison, and a revision of the traditional plant disease control principles. Plant Disease Epidemiology is an upper-level course for students interested in plant pathology, agronomy, data-driven Ag, national or international agriculture, or closely related areas. Although some pathosystems are used as model systems, Plant Disease Epidemiology is not a \"how-to\" course on controlling specific plant diseases. **Credits:** 3.00"

The course will be a broad overview of different techniques that can be used to model biological systems. Each lecture topic in this course could itself form an entire course, so students will not complete the course as experts in mathematical modeling. Instead, the objectives are to: 1) expose students to a number of tools in mathematical modeling; 2) give students some practical experience with these tools; and 3) develop a component of their thesis research into a model.

The course involves the application of several fundamental chemical engineering principles, including those related to mass transfer, separations, and fluid flow, to devices used for extracorporeal therapies and other treatments. The first part of the course addresses the relevant physiology and pathophysiology serving as a foundation for subsequent clinical material. With the focus on extracorporeal devices, the interactions between blood and biomaterials in a general sense are also explored. The second part of the course assesses the extracorporeal treatment of kidney failure by dialysis, which is highlighted as the only long-term, device-based replacement therapy for terminal organ failure (end-stage renal disease). This analysis will not only consider the evolution of dialysis therapy from a technology perspective but also the forces that have shaped its development into a market generating annual revenue of nearly $100 billion on a global basis. In addition, extracorporeal support therapies used clinically not only for failure of other organs (namely the heart, liver, and lungs) but also systemic inflammation secondary to severe infection (sepsis) will be presented. The third segment of the course addresses industry-focused concepts pertaining to medical device development, including verification/validation, lean manufacturing, project management, and regulatory issues. Providing a real-world perspective based on broad experience in the medical device field, Ms. Michelle Chutka (see below) will lead this third part of the course.

    "description": "Over the last decade, the field of strategic communication has grown rapidly. The work of strategic communication professionals requires coordinated responses between distinct organizational units that are often separated by time and space. These conditions necessitate effective leadership. Further complicating leadership in these contexts is the fact that the work of strategic communication has increasingly become global in nature. This course provides students with theoretical background in leadership and global strategic communication, as well as the opportunity to apply what they learn to strategic communication cases and to their own professional experiences. It also encourages them to think proactively about leadership challenges in these contexts and to articulate theoreticallyinformed analyses and evaluations of leadership in action.

    "description": "In both research and industry game engines are the foundation for nearly all graphics-intensive interactive applications. A thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a requisite element of the game development process and lever for research in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game engine development, research, and application is a large and complex topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on and within game engines. This course introduces students to the fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, active-learning pedagogy in which students codevelop and present lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of game development or game engine design is required.  **Credits:** 3.00"

Examples of such are the computers on your car's engine that control fuel injection, fly-by-wire attitude controls in modern jet aircraft, even the microcontroller inside a cellular phone. In these examples, the computer has a specific, limited task that is part of the functionality of the device and specifying average performance of that computer is insufficient for successful completion of the task at hand. Imagine if the flight controls of a Boeing 787 on final landing approach experienced a \"network lag\" similar to that which occurs occasionally while you're reading e-mail. If the controls stop responding at a critical time, a horrific crash could occur. Even if the system doesn't freeze up 99.999% of the time, it can still result in disaster.**Credits:** 3.00"

We will consider different varieties of creole languages and (their) cultures including English-based creoles in West Africa such as Kru (Liberia and Sierra Leone), Nigerian Pidgin and Cameroonian Pidgin; in the Caribbean such as Jamaican, San Andreas, Nicaraguan and Limonense, contrasting them with the Spanish-based creole Palenquero; and the three most predominant creoles in the U.S. Louisiana Creole, Gullah and Hawaii Creole, to understand their characteristics and their history. We will explore the ways in which the languages manifest in the music and literature of the contexts where they are spoken. Finally, we will consider the African diaspora as a fundamental thread that ties (English-based) creole languages and peoples together. In exploring these issues, the course will draw on a variety of theoretical concepts and traditions from sociolinguistics, creole studies and African American studies.  **Credits:** 3.00"

    "description": "Reflective practice is a term coined by Donald Sch\u00f6n in The Reflective Practitioner (1983). Reflective practice is the capacity to reflect on action to engage in a process of continuous learning. Reflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal learning or knowledge transfer. It may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice. A person who reflects throughout their practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to their existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding. Critical reflection as part of experiential education generates, deepens, and documents learning. As a result of this course, you will be able to articulate the value of your experiential education opportunities toward marketing yourself for potential job opportunities and develop the skills needed to become a reflective practitioner for promotional growth in your future career.

This 300-level course examines basic concepts of toxicology in human health as they apply to the exposure of environmental agents, e.g., chemicals, metals, and poisons in daily life and attempted poisoning in criminal cases and political assassins. With an emphasis on historical accounts of poisonings and cases analyses, the course describes commonly encountered chemicals and poisons, their symptoms, clinical diagnosis, basic toxicological mechanisms, and medical interventions. Students will also learn some of the large-scale environmental and occupational incidents that have led to legal actions, and the role of toxicology in forensic investigation of purposed poisoning. The course is ideal to students who are inspired to become a future healthcare professional in any of the health-oriented pre-professional programs or students with majors in biomedical health sciences, environmental and occupational health sciences, medical laboratory science, and/or public health.  **Credits:** 2.00"

This course asks: how do the materials we use to re-create the human body affect the way that we construct our humanity? We will examine the different materials people have used to replicate the body throughout history. The course is organized thematically by materials such as wood, wax, silicone, and digital media. This course emphasizes hands-on learning; we will cast wax masks, sculpt clay figurines, and create automata, among other experiential activities. The types of replicants we will study in this course range from voodoo dolls to Real Dolls, death masks to Deep Fakes, and statues to cyborgs. For the final project, you will choose a case study of a replicant to write about in an exploratory paper.  **Credits:** 3.00"

In this course, we will examine many laws and the practical ways you can stay on the right side of the law. Don't worry, you aren't in a law school class and I don't expect you to become employment attorneys. However, I will help you gain a working knowledge of employment laws including: The Civil Rights Act, ADA, ADEA, FMLA, FLSA, and a host of alphabet soup. We will also apply these laws from posting a job description to recruiting to hiring to employee reviews to terminating an employee. While I can't guarantee you will never be sued by a disgruntled current or former employee, I can help you put yourself and your company in the best possible position to defend that suit. And don't worry: we will look at lots of quick case studies (less than a page) to give you context you can easily remember. **Credits:** 2.00"

Course activities, readings and homework assignments will provide students with illustration of how the problem-solving process can be applied to specific selfcare situations that arise in practice. Active learning methods will be employed to involve students directly in the actual application of this process to simulated practice problems. Topics: Colds, Coughs, Allergies.  1.00"

Most classes will begin with a guest speaker giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals. **Credits:** 1.00"

What are the human and environmental costs of a full-throated adoption of AI? This class will arm you with the philosophical and historical background to begin to devise and weigh the creative opportunities and challenges posed by this future.

Furthermore, the abstract nature of philosophical discourse places a large cognitive demand upon readers. This course prepares non-native English speakers philosophy students for these intensive reading demands. The course has three major learning areas: the language skills that students need to read fluently (i.e., the efficient processing of language for general comprehension of meaning); reading strategies that students can use to improve comprehension and learning; and communication about readings, as the close reading of texts is essential to communicating one's ideas both orally and in writing. Students are also supported in their regular philosophy courses. This course is linked to one or more 500+ level philosophy seminars that students in this course are enrolled in. Reading materials, writing activities, and projects for the course are designed to complement tasks and projects required in the linked philosophy seminar."

The course will be focused on learning physical science by doing science i.e. developing understanding by collaborative activities and discussion in the laboratory and lecture and communicating your ideas to others. The course will have one 50-minute lecture and two 110-minute laboratory meetings each week. The course content is consistent with the CAEP (Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation) K-6 Elementary Teacher Preparation Standards (Standard 2: Understanding and Applying Content and Curricular Knowledge for Teaching in *Physical Science* and *Engineering Design*) and the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) for the Physical Sciences (*Physical Sciences* PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4) as well as many of the Science and Engineering Practices (SEPs). The course will be divided into four units: 1) Matter and Interactions, 2) Motion and Stability, 3) Energy, and 4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering design involves many different practices: problem definition, model development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data, application of mathematics and computational thinking, and determination of solutions. **Credits:**"

With a \"service learning\" orientation, students enrolled in this course should expect to learn and build upon the fundamental principles related to the design and implementation of instructional materials in classroom or informal learning environments, and assessment of learning. Materials developed could contribute to the repertoire of practicing teachers and/or Physics Outreach. **Credits:** 1.00 to 3.00"

At this point in time it is critical that we look at both domesticparticularly in the United States-and transnational forms of terrorism. The study of terrorism is rife with puzzles that we will explore. Why resort to violence in the first place? How and why do groups evolve over time? How and why do some groups end, and others continue for years? Why are some individuals/groups not classified as terrorists? What are the consequences of terrorism? We will also look closely at counterterrorism policy. What are the most effective ways to respond to terrorism? What doesn't work? How do policies differ between states? To what extent is there global cooperation on counterterrorism? We will conclude the class by taking a critical look at US counterterrorism policy and the massive counterterrorism apparatus that has developed in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001."

The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power.

During the past few decades, there has been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury. **Credits:** 3.00"

Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the three most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required. **Credits:** 3.00"

The main goal of this course is to encourage students to think like global engineers by focusing curricular activities on engineering case studies from a humanistic-engineering perspective. The case studies examined in the course may include past, present, and hypothetical engineering successes and failures; analyses will require engineering skills combined with understanding of cultural perspectives of local communities and cultural context (i.e., sociological, anthropological, and historical information and analyses that contribute to cultural understanding). This humanities-infused approach will encourage students to develop a new mindset--a way of seeing current and hypothetical engineering plans, projects, and impacts through local communities' pasts and presents, unique values, perspectives, and daily ways of life.

During the past few decades, there has been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury. **Credits:** 3.00"

It is essential that audiologists have a firm understanding of the most common causes and medical treatments of hearing impairment for all age groups. Additionally, the future clinician will be better served by recognizing the how rapidly information changes in this arena and becoming comfortable with reliable educational resources that are available for life-long learning in this area. Audiologists also practice in a medical setting and thus must be comfortable with the medical approaches and terminology used by otolaryngologists, otologists, neuro-otologists, pediatricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists and other physicians. Additionally, audiologists may be the first contact with a hearing-impaired patient and their role in the referral process will be emphasized. Typically offered Spring.**Credits:** 3.00"
