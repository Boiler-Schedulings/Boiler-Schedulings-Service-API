    "description": "Credit Hours: 3.00.  The usage of materials is the backbone of engineering practice. Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity, and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals. Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, and grain boundaries.

Almost everyone has heard of the human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have been sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, but technological and computational progress has made it progressively easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any other field of the life sciences - mostly because it touches on all areas of study. The course will focus on the impact that genomes will have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the College of Science is well represented in the science and technology. We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical questions (or at least pose better questions): What is the basis of personalized medicine? What does genomics tell us about the genealogy of mankind? What impact will genomics have on our future food supply and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the gut microbiome, the mouthmicrobiome, etc? What impact will genomics have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but also the ethical and societal implications.

Topics to be covered include: Amino acids, peptides and proteins, molecular models and structure-function relationships, enzymes, enzyme kinetics and enzyme mechanisms, carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolism, aerobic metabolism, lipids and membranes, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism and integration and regulation of metabolism. Special emphasis will be placed on connections between biochemical principles and the fields of medicine, human health and disease, nutrition and biotechnology. This course should serve as excellent preparation for higher-level biochemistry courses as well as standardized pre-health professional exams. CHM 33900 was designed as the 4lh semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science students at Purdue. However, this course is open to other students who meet the prerequisites. 3.00 "

Examples of such are the computers on your car's engine that control fuel injection, fly-by-wire attitude controls in modern jet aircraft, even the microcontroller inside a cellular phone. In these examples, the computer has a specific, limited task that is part of the functionality of the device and specifying average performance of that computer is insufficient for successful completion of the task at hand. Imagine if the flight controls of a Boeing 787 on final landing approach experienced a \"network lag\" similar to that which occurs occasionally while you're reading e-mail.

    "description": "Credit Hours: 1.00.  Reflective practice is a term coined by Donald Sch\u00f6n in The Reflective Practitioner (1983). Reflective practice is the capacity to reflect on action to engage in a process of continuous learning. Reflective practice can be an important tool in practice-based professional learning settings where people learn from their own professional experiences, rather than from formal learning or knowledge transfer. It may be the most important source of personal professional development and improvement. It is also an important way to bring together theory and practice. A person who reflects throughout their practice is not just looking back on past actions and events, but is taking a conscious look at emotions, experiences, actions, and responses, and using that information to add to their existing knowledge base and reach a higher level of understanding. Critical reflection as part of experiential education generates, deepens, and documents learning. As a result of this course, you will be able to articulate the value of your experiential education opportunities toward marketing yourself for potential job opportunities and develop the skills needed to become a reflective practitioner for promotional growth in your future career.

This 300-level course examines basic concepts of toxicology in human health as they apply to the exposure of environmental agents, e.g., chemicals, metals, and poisons in daily life and attempted poisoning in criminal cases and political assassins. With an emphasis on historical accounts of poisonings and cases analyses, the course describes commonly encountered chemicals and poisons, their symptoms, clinical diagnosis, basic toxicological mechanisms, and medical interventions. Students will also learn some of the large-scale environmental and occupational incidents that have led to legal actions, and the role of toxicology in forensic investigation of purposed poisoning. The course is ideal to students who are inspired to become a future healthcare professional in any of the health-oriented pre-professional programs or students with majors in biomedical health sciences, environmental and occupational health sciences, medical laboratory science, and/or public health.  **Credits:** 2.00 "

At this point in time it is critical that we look at both domesticparticularly in the United States-and transnational forms of terrorism. The study of terrorism is rife with puzzles that we will explore. Why resort to violence in the first place? How and why do groups evolve over time? How and why do some groups end, and others continue for years? Why are some individuals/groups not classified as terrorists? What are the consequences of terrorism? We will also look closely at counterterrorism policy. What are the most effective ways to respond to terrorism? What doesn't work? How do policies differ between states? To what extent is there global cooperation on counterterrorism? We will conclude the class by taking a critical look at US counterterrorism policy and the massive counterterrorism apparatus that has developed in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001.

    "description": "Credit Hours: 3.00.  Globalization is a very popular topic, resulting in a lot of loose and poorly thought-through talk and writing around the subject. The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the \"century of shame.\" Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! **Credits:** 3.00 "

Does consciousness have an adaptive function? Might a person in a coma or a vegetative state still have some form of awareness? Could a computer or a robot ever have what we would consider to be genuine experiences? During the past few decades, these and other questions about the nature of consciousness have been the focus of increasing empirical and theoretical research in neuroscience and other disciplines. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to this exciting field of inquiry by exposing them to a variety of representative books and articles in the literature.

    "title": "Psy 62101 - Genes, Brain And Behavior",
    "description": "Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines how genes regulate development and function of the brain to ultimately influence behavior. Genetics has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to understand and think critically about the genetic components of Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the three most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus on learning & memory and mental illness. However, if students are interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of these papers. Permission of department required. **Credits:** 3.00 "

The main goal of this course is to encourage students to think like global engineers by focusing curricular activities on engineering case studies from a humanistic-engineering perspective. The case studies examined in the course may include past, present, and hypothetical engineering successes and failures; analyses will require engineering skills combined with understanding of cultural perspectives of local communities and cultural context (i.e., sociological, anthropological, and historical information and analyses that contribute to cultural understanding). This humanities-infused approach will encourage students to develop a new mindset--a way of seeing current and hypothetical engineering plans, projects, and impacts through local communities' pasts and presents, unique values, perspectives, and daily ways of life.
