Did you know that these two were considered as one specialization? I was admitted to AAE in 2020, and by the semester they used 2019 curriculum, which only had 5, where A&C and ASA are together: Dynamics & Controls (D&C). Actually, since I am admitted to 2020 FYE curriculum but switched to AAE in the same year and rushed through it in 1.5 years, 2020 AAE curriculum was not set to my case; I'm probably a D&C in the Purdue system, as my advisor said I'm officially ASA student but I can pick former D&C courses (which is sum of A&C and ASA) for my AAE spec requirements. It's kinda jeopardized but it's how it is.\n\nASA is just astrodynamics and space \"application,\" meaning you are just doing dynamics and things but focusing on more space-related problems. A&C is in a close relationship with dynamics, and you are just applying the A&C stuff in ASA. I do highly recommend picking up A&C and ASA if you wanna do GN&C (guidance, navigation, and control) engineering thing, or anything related to space orbital stuff itself. However, I do not recommend doing other two, as I consider other couples are totally different disciplines.\n\nPersonally, I'm working on spacecraft trajectory optimization. Trajectory here is more like ASA, but optimization is more like A&C stuff. These two go really well."}

CT Sun's problems are very similar to Doyle although I personally didn't like CT Sun's book. If you don't like CT Sun's explanations, then consider the book *Aircraft Structures for Engineering Students* by Megson; I know the material is similar to CT Sun but I didn't consult it much for AAE 352 myself so I can't really endorse it. Todd Coburn on YouTube seems to be a good additional resource, although it's not clear to me whether he covers all the necessary material you'd need for AAE 352.  \n**AAE 333**: The textbook *Fluid Mechanics* by White is great for learning the material and extra practice problems. Anderson is a good aerodynamics book, but horrible fluid mechanics book because his sections on fluid mechanics are tailored to people who already know fluid mechanics. Ron Hugo and Fluid Matters (who lectures out of White) are the best fluid mechanics channels.  \n**AAE 364**: Brian Douglas, katkimshow, and Neso Academy on YouTube provided the best videos in my opinion. I personally liked *Modern Control Systems* (Dorf, Bishop) more than Ogata because it takes more time relating controls to real-world concepts. Also it has way more practice problems than Ogata, which you might find useful for exam prep. In general, though, if you feel like you're flat-out not understanding controls no matter what resource you're looking at then there's a possibility your knowledge of circuits is holding you back which is unfortunate given that AAE doesn't make you take circuits (I don't consider PHYS 241 sufficient) whereas you wouldn't be allowed to take controls if without a circuits class if you were an ME or EE student. If you feel like circuits is holding you back, then *Fundamentals of Electric Circuits* (Alexander, Sadiku) is an excellent textbook to consult. There might also be a possibility that your knowledge of dynamics could hold you back, meaning you should consult my Reddit post regarding AAE 340.

Did you know that these two were considered as one specialization? I was admitted to AAE in 2020, and by the semester they used 2019 curriculum, which only had 5, where A&C and ASA are together: Dynamics & Controls (D&C). Actually, since I am admitted to 2020 FYE curriculum but switched to AAE in the same year and rushed through it in 1.5 years, 2020 AAE curriculum was not set to my case; I'm probably a D&C in the Purdue system, as my advisor said I'm officially ASA student but I can pick former D&C courses (which is sum of A&C and ASA) for my AAE spec requirements. It's kinda jeopardized but it's how it is.\n\nASA is just astrodynamics and space \"application,\" meaning you are just doing dynamics and things but focusing on more space-related problems. A&C is in a close relationship with dynamics, and you are just applying the A&C stuff in ASA. I do highly recommend picking up A&C and ASA if you wanna do GN&C (guidance, navigation, and control) engineering thing, or anything related to space orbital stuff itself. However, I do not recommend doing other two, as I consider other couples are totally different disciplines.\n\nPersonally, I'm working on spacecraft trajectory optimization. Trajectory here is more like ASA, but optimization is more like A&C stuff. These two go really well."}

But also don't overwhelm yourself!\n\n340 can be pretty time consuming; when I took it, homework was long and the exams were very hit-or-miss.  Lectures were taught well by Longuski.  In my mind, this course is part of the \"AAE Junior Year Marathon\" if that makes sense, meaning it can be rough.\n\n352 could not pay me enough money to ever take it again.  I took it with Doyle in Spring 2020, so your mileage may vary, but the notes were horrid.  Homework was ok-ish and the exam (one, singular exam due to COVID) was fair.  I'm not a structures guy and this was not an interesting class in the slightest.\n\n251, 301, 333 are also very fundamental AAE classes that can take a lot of time.

It is also normal to take 334, 340, 364, 33401, and 338 within the same semester. It's definitely tough but that's expected for Junior year. Try not to add more to these schedules as is - they form the foundation for classes you'll take later on, so you want to learn from them well.\n\nThat being said, I second taking STAT 511 your senior year. It teaches concepts similar to AP Stats but not entirely, so you'll still need to relearn a couple things. It will be tough or easy depending on the professor you get. In my experience it served as a good break from my other AAE classes, but it still took up a good chunk of my time. Thus, taking it along with your other classes next year may not be a good idea.\n\nAlso, is there any way you can take 20401 at any other time except these next two semesters? It can be pretty time consuming."}

Did you know that these two were considered as one specialization? I was admitted to AAE in 2020, and by the semester they used 2019 curriculum, which only had 5, where A&C and ASA are together: Dynamics & Controls (D&C). Actually, since I am admitted to 2020 FYE curriculum but switched to AAE in the same year and rushed through it in 1.5 years, 2020 AAE curriculum was not set to my case; I'm probably a D&C in the Purdue system, as my advisor said I'm officially ASA student but I can pick former D&C courses (which is sum of A&C and ASA) for my AAE spec requirements. It's kinda jeopardized but it's how it is.\n\nASA is just astrodynamics and space \"application,\" meaning you are just doing dynamics and things but focusing on more space-related problems. A&C is in a close relationship with dynamics, and you are just applying the A&C stuff in ASA. I do highly recommend picking up A&C and ASA if you wanna do GN&C (guidance, navigation, and control) engineering thing, or anything related to space orbital stuff itself. However, I do not recommend doing other two, as I consider other couples are totally different disciplines.\n\nPersonally, I'm working on spacecraft trajectory optimization. Trajectory here is more like ASA, but optimization is more like A&C stuff. These two go really well."}

And then we'll touch on reliability & failure which should be cool.  The class isn't technical in the sense of \"design this\" but rather \"think about everything surrounding this product\".  For our missile, we will likely just specify what requirements it has and focus on detailing how it will operate, how it will be stored, etc.  Basically designing everything but the missile haha (other projects include moon landers, delivery drones for packages, VTOL urban transport, there's lots to pick from)"}

It's kinda jeopardized but it's how it is.\n\nASA is just astrodynamics and space \"application,\" meaning you are just doing dynamics and things but focusing on more space-related problems. A&C is in a close relationship with dynamics, and you are just applying the A&C stuff in ASA. I do highly recommend picking up A&C and ASA if you wanna do GN&C (guidance, navigation, and control) engineering thing, or anything related to space orbital stuff itself. However, I do not recommend doing other two, as I consider other couples are totally different disciplines.\n\nPersonally, I'm working on spacecraft trajectory optimization. Trajectory here is more like ASA, but optimization is more like A&C stuff. These two go really well."}

I find it absolutely mindblowing that people come to Purdue and do super crazy things with their schedules, deviating from the typical graduate-in-4-with-a-bachelors. I only know of three other people who have successfully graduated in 2 years- and they were absolutely up to their eyeballs in work. On top of that, you did it in a language that's not even your native tongue- that's super impressive man.   \n\n\nWishing you all the best in your next steps, wherever they may be."}

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science). For example, if a student with no dual/AP credits has a 3.2+ GPA in MA 161, CHM 115, and ENGL 106, then they will probably get into FYE.

With the first two, you might have some free time during your shift to get work done, but that also makes those jobs competitive (at least when I was there).\n\nPersonally, I worked at the Cary Knight Spot my freshmen and sophomore years and I did not regret it. They work around your class schedule, as I sometimes had 7:30am classes, so they did not schedule me for the closing shifts that go until 2am. You may have to work on Sundays as those are its busiest days (Dining courts are closed Sundays for dinner), but if you have a religious obligation on Sundays, tell them beforehand.\n\nI personally liked it more than working in the dining courts. I worked at one of the courts for a week and hated it since I felt that all I did was run back and forth between the kitchen and serving area with trays of food. There was something rewarding about putting together an entire meal for someone (as weird as that sounds, and even though it was mostly fast food). You also get a 20 minute break and a meal every shift, so you can be on a smaller dining plan.\n\nIt's a minimum wage job, but when you're working 10-15 hours a week, living in the dorms with little to no bills to pay, that extra money comes in handy.

Living with all the 141/142 students in one building is an incredible resource especially since almost 50% of the class is done in 4-person teams. That all being said, do not be scared away by anything I just said. There is an incredible sense of accomplishment for completing this course and you gain IMMEDIATE street cred on campus when it comes up in conversation that you took that class. In fact, the class is so legendary in rigor, that employers at job fairs sometimes know about it! Leads to great stories in job interviews... which is a huge benefit! I would have been totally screwed in some interviews if it weren't for that class. Glad it's over but worth it! To further spread this message, I'll actually be TA'ing for the course this year."}

Most likely he will stay where he has already signed, be it dorms or apartments, or other.  \n\n>How often will he be gone at the frat during the year?\n\nThat depends as well, and mainly on your roomate and what tiem of the year it is.  He will be over there for mandatory events such as but not limited to: rush, all house meetings, officer meetings, social events, philanthropic events, and any other meeting or commitee or obligation he has.  Another reason he may be there is for personal reasons.  If he enjoys being there and wants to hang out with peopel eh may be over there quite a bit, jsut like you may go to your friends place to hang out.  \n\nNow, during \"rush\" which is held at the beginning of the fall and sometimes spring semester. He will probably be there quite a bit.  Most houses hold rush events two times a week for a few hours each time.  All house meetings are mostly held once a week, nromally on Sunday.  All other events are held at any time, and most not on a certain schedule.  \n\nSo most of his time early on will be at rush, but it could be larger with any other social/personal time he spends there.  \n\n>Am curious as I might join him and I don't know how living in the residence hall works alongside joining a fraternity...\n\nIt happens all the time.  If you never \"lived in\" you would be an \"out of house brother\".  Different houses have different requirements on how long you have to \"live in\" and that may influence your decision.  \n\n\n\nLast, but not least, look at all of the options.

Also, take a look at how this will impact you in the long run. It seems like in a severe case you could end up taking one extra semester to graduate. While that\u2019s not ideal, it could help you spread out your major classes and result in you getting better grades with less stress. \n\nAs far as adding in electives, the minor programs at Purdue have some phenomenal classes. The dance department welcomes all skill levels including adults who have never taken any movement classes. Bowling is a class I\u2019ve heard really good things about. If you\u2019re looking for something more related to your major but with less stress, find your favorite professor and see if an independent study would be possible. \n\nYou are going to get through this!

For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

Being disappointed that you didn\u2019t do the additional advising appointment is a valid feeling. \n\nHowever I think there are also some valid alternative thoughts to consider. For example, it\u2019s likely that had you done the additional advising appointment, the classes may have still been full. Some classes are just really hard to get into. Also, take a look at how this will impact you in the long run. It seems like in a severe case you could end up taking one extra semester to graduate. While that\u2019s not ideal, it could help you spread out your major classes and result in you getting better grades with less stress. \n\nAs far as adding in electives, the minor programs at Purdue have some phenomenal classes. The dance department welcomes all skill levels including adults who have never taken any movement classes. Bowling is a class I\u2019ve heard really good things about. If you\u2019re looking for something more related to your major but with less stress, find your favorite professor and see if an independent study would be possible. \n\nYou are going to get through this!

{"code": "At 20700", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE incoming Junior - Open Registration and now I'm REALLY screwed | COMMENT_BODY: Don't worry it's definitely not all lost, there is plenty of stuff you can still take. For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

I'm going to be a senior this coming fall and will double major in physics and mathematics.  I believe I may have some helpful tips for you.\n\nTo do meaningful, relevant research in physics, you would definitely need to earn a Ph.D.  Most of the physics material one has to learn to participate in some of today's hot-button research is taught at graduate schools.  But this is doable!  Don't let this amount of schooling (which is usually six more years after Purdue) intimidate you.  If you truly are passionate about physics, spending just a couple more years at a university would be no obstacle.\n\nBut I must note that you do not have to major in physics to be accepted into a physics graduate program.  Actually, having a major in CS would be quite valuable.  Most physics students (at least at Purdue) leave with not much experience with coding and simulating.  And much of the undergraduate research opportunities here require lots of coding!  Your passion for computer science would help you stand out from the crowd.\n\nAlso, double majoring in physics and computer science is perfect for the buzzing research field called **Quantum Computing**.  I encourage you to explore the details and implications of this topic.  It is worthy to note that the Purdue Quantum Center is a wonderful and fulfilling group that has a strong focus in quantum computing.  It is known to have participating undergraduate researchers helping out in any way they can.\n\nAnd for your track to graduation, I'm sure it will work out.  I recommend talking with your advisor as well as the undergraduate physics advisor Janice Thomaz."}

Which means you need to get into a physics graduate program, which is a lot easier with a Physics major than without. You may be able to overcome having only a minor with some experience researching in a physics lab, which is always an option.\n\nSo none of the courses you listed have 344 as a prereq.

{"code": "At 36900", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE T2M for Spring Questions | COMMENT_BODY: 2k7 and 270 are both 3 hour lab classes that can have large time sinks depending on how much you already know about circuits and circuit building. People usually take 270 after 2k7 because 2k7 is essentially the intro to circuit building course that teaches you all the basics. If you have no previous knowledge about circuit building/design I would not take 270 since it will use stuff most people only learn about in 2k7.\n\nECE 369 and 270 don't have any relation that would limit you from taking one or the other at the same time. I took ECE 369 and found it to be pretty easy (from someone who struggled through every other math class), I think it depends on the professor but mine had lots of extra credit and an A was like 85% I think.\n\nUltimately I would recommend switching out 270 for a Gen-Ed, unless you already have a lot of breadboard experience from somewhere and know Verilog pretty well. If you stick with it just know that you will have 2 huge 3 hour labs taking up your time each week so you might not even be able to take all these classes due to limitations on when certain classes are scheduled (i.e. some classes are only one lecture at a specific time and another class might only fit at that same time as well)."}

Pretty painful experience, but I am not SWE. The course is not taught exceedingly well (taught by a grad student), so most of your learning will be done individually through prelabs every week.

Not saying that it isn't similar to the CS180 curriculum but second half of the semester covers more abstract java concepts not covered in AP CS A, like concurrency or dynamic data structures (stacks/queue/hashmaps). I do know some classmates who took AP CS A in high school who were cocky during the first half of the semester and breezed through the material. But come the second half they struggled as they weren't willing to put in the work outside of class to actually understand the content. So while being confident with programming in java is one thing which can help you, understanding the material in depth is critical to succeeding in the course. \n\nAlso OP to the point where you want to do COM 217, the reason why freshmen don't typically take it is because most upperclassmen CS / other STEM majors need to take the course to graduate as it's part of the university core curriculum."}

Most of the course is based on various group and individual presentations throughout the semester. The only \"homework\" for the class is outlines and scripts for your presentations. There aren't any exams, but there are quizzes based on assigned reading that are worth maybe 10-15% of your grade. If I remember correctly, quizzes were biweekly and based on the book- really easy if you actually read the 20-30 (regular sized, not textbook) pages that were assigned.\n\nOverall, a pretty easy class without too much work, but you do actually have to do the work that's assigned (and not at the last minute) and follow directions carefully. Obviously, presenting is a big part of it, so if you have trouble with public speaking or writing, you'll have more difficulty with the course."}

My 2 sense on everything:\n1. It's summer and Purdue is a really hard school. Go like enjoy it while you can. If you REALLY need to study over the summer I would brush up on calculus as that will likely be your hardest class for a while.\n2. Honors contracting courses is really nice because you take a class you have to take anyway and get honors credit for it. If you really want to do an honors class they aren't the worst. Just pick one you like the subject material. If you want to squeeze in some extra credit go on one of the fall break trips. You lose fall break but it's an easy credit.\n3. It's going to be small. There are plenty of lists out there for what to bring but a mattress topper is a God send. Also bring like emergency food like pop tarts.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: Hi! I am in BMHS (pre-med) and I am also in the honors college.\n\n1) HONR 19901 rarely has a textbook - if ever. There are reading a to do but they are provided. I am a mentor and will be a mentor again this year. BIOL 11000 does have a textbook but you can often buy a second hand copy or like get an ebook online. If you DM me I can help you with this. I didn\u2019t take CHM 115 so I can\u2019t comment. HSCI 101 is a class I used to TA for and this class is a bunch of guest lectures - just show up to class on time. I also didn\u2019t take MA16010. I have the textbooks I used for PSY 12000 and SOC 10000 which were the same ones they used this year, so I presume they will use them again. If you DM I can share. Additionally in myPurdue there is a \u201ctextbooks\u201d section where you can go to look at assigned textbooks. I would wait before formally purchasing any because sometimes it\u2019s just a recommended book but not required - and in that case. Don\u2019t waste your money.\n\n2) A lot of your normal classes can be made into honors courses via honors contracting. This often includes writing another paper or doing an extra assignment. I know first hand that contracting BIOL 110 and PSY 120 are extremely easy. I just had to write an extra paper and they were both on topics of my choice. Otherwise HONR 299 courses are great. They change pretty regularly but I really recommend Dean\u2019s Seminar, Learning Across Differences, etc.\n\n3) bring less than what you think you need is my biggest piece of advice. If you want to DM me what your dorm hall is, I can probably get a picture for you. I would also bring storage containers. I think a good rule of thumb that I wish I followed would be 3 storage tubes (decent size ones MAX). One for winter stuff, one for summer/spring/formal stuff (it\u2019s not warm that long anyway), and one for bedding/personal items!\n\nFeel free to ask me anymore questions.

I would definitely recommend looking at material beforehand just to get your brain in the \"zone\" since these classes are pretty hefty. The only classes I didn't take that you are taking are HONR 19901 and PSY 120. I heard that the honors classes aren't terrible and my friend took PSY 120 and said it was an easy A and he barely studied for it. I didn't take it since I got AP credit, but overall I've heard it's not bad at all. For BIOL 110 it's very easy if you have Sean Humphrey. He's an amazing professor, and I would recommend going to his lectures. He prepares you for exams well. Make sure you take notes and study the exam review guides since they're very similar to the actual exams. CHM 115 was difficult for me, but I also hate chemistry so I inevitably struggled. Make sure to do all the practice problems for exams and make sure you know the material well. Read the textbook and do the problems in there. The exams are known to be hard, and they are so knowing the material thoroughly is very important. Going to lecture is a necessity to succeed in the class and paying attention in labs. HSCI 101 is easy. It's mostly guest speakers. I would recommend taking notes on a computer and not hand write them since there's way too much to write it all by hand. Make sure to study for the midterm and final though since the questions are very specific to what the guests talk about on their powerpoints. Also, going to lecture is mandatory and they have a scantron for attendance so you must get there on time and you cannot leave early. MA 16010 was tough for me as well, but math isn't my strong suit. Just make sure to go to lecture and do lots and lots of practice problems and you will be fine. If you ever get lost make sure you get help because it's easy to fall behind and not understand the material since it all builds off the past unit. SOC 100 is a lot of memorization. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine. The exams are mostly just applying information to scenarios. I took it all online though so it might be different in person. \n2. I didn't live in Honors but I knew a few people who did. I will say the rooms are HUGE compared to regular double/triple rooms because the ceilings are a lot higher. Some things I would recommend getting for a dorm that I wish I knew before college were shower shoes (A MUST), enough snacks/bars (i found myself getting hungry on campus and didn't want to go back  to my room), PAPER TOWELS you run out of them faster than you think you will, don't buy dishes just get plastic utensils and paper plates trust me you won't want to do dishes, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I'm more than happy to answer them just feel free to DM me!"}

The only other HONR class worth taking after 19901 and 19902 is the HONR version of ENGL 106. However, if you have credit for that class already don\u2019t bother. I recommend contracting or taking two honors level courses (you get honors credit if there is an \u201cH\u201d at the end of the course CRN) each semester until the end of your sophomore year. Upper division classes are already difficult and professors are less likely to allow you to contract so get all those credits out of the way before you get to any 400 level courses."}

Most of the course is based on various group and individual presentations throughout the semester. The only \"homework\" for the class is outlines and scripts for your presentations. There aren't any exams, but there are quizzes based on assigned reading that are worth maybe 10-15% of your grade. If I remember correctly, quizzes were biweekly and based on the book- really easy if you actually read the 20-30 (regular sized, not textbook) pages that were assigned.\n\nOverall, a pretty easy class without too much work, but you do actually have to do the work that's assigned (and not at the last minute) and follow directions carefully. Obviously, presenting is a big part of it, so if you have trouble with public speaking or writing, you'll have more difficulty with the course."}

And all the other credits that you have.\n\nHere\u2019s why: (this holds true for almost all STEM classes)\n\n1. Most STEM classes at Purdue require a significant amount of effort and there\u2019s nothing like an \u201ceasy A\u201d. Especially with Purdue Math and their BS system (limited A grades).\n\n2. If you have studied the material, there\u2019s no point wasting time on it again. You can always go back and refresh if needed.\n\n3. Even if you decide to take the class, there\u2019s high chance that you\u2019ll become lazy (its college, there are a lot of distractions), spend less time on it and end up with a not so good grade which will eventually hurt your GPA.\n\n4. AP Credits can help you graduate early / help you pick up additional minors / or even let you take other interesting classes at Purdue which might not be required for your major. \n\nPS: I took 115 freshman year and ended up with a B just because I was lazy. (I had 7:30am labs which lasted for 2-3 hours) I had done the same stuff in high school and was good at it but it\u2019s a lot of work so it doesn\u2019t make sense taking the class if you have the credits.

Do not take this class before you take Engr 132. Matlab is easier to learn for beginner, but C is not. C is not as high level as Python.

If you REALLY need to study over the summer I would brush up on calculus as that will likely be your hardest class for a while.\n2. Honors contracting courses is really nice because you take a class you have to take anyway and get honors credit for it. If you really want to do an honors class they aren't the worst. Just pick one you like the subject material. If you want to squeeze in some extra credit go on one of the fall break trips. You lose fall break but it's an easy credit.\n3. It's going to be small.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: Hi! I am in BMHS (pre-med) and I am also in the honors college.\n\n1) HONR 19901 rarely has a textbook - if ever. There are reading a to do but they are provided. I am a mentor and will be a mentor again this year. BIOL 11000 does have a textbook but you can often buy a second hand copy or like get an ebook online. If you DM me I can help you with this. I didn\u2019t take CHM 115 so I can\u2019t comment. HSCI 101 is a class I used to TA for and this class is a bunch of guest lectures - just show up to class on time. I also didn\u2019t take MA16010. I have the textbooks I used for PSY 12000 and SOC 10000 which were the same ones they used this year, so I presume they will use them again. If you DM I can share. Additionally in myPurdue there is a \u201ctextbooks\u201d section where you can go to look at assigned textbooks. I would wait before formally purchasing any because sometimes it\u2019s just a recommended book but not required - and in that case. Don\u2019t waste your money.\n\n2) A lot of your normal classes can be made into honors courses via honors contracting. This often includes writing another paper or doing an extra assignment. I know first hand that contracting BIOL 110 and PSY 120 are extremely easy. I just had to write an extra paper and they were both on topics of my choice. Otherwise HONR 299 courses are great. They change pretty regularly but I really recommend Dean\u2019s Seminar, Learning Across Differences, etc.\n\n3) bring less than what you think you need is my biggest piece of advice. If you want to DM me what your dorm hall is, I can probably get a picture for you. I would also bring storage containers. I think a good rule of thumb that I wish I followed would be 3 storage tubes (decent size ones MAX). One for winter stuff, one for summer/spring/formal stuff (it\u2019s not warm that long anyway), and one for bedding/personal items!\n\nFeel free to ask me anymore questions.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: I wasn't in the honors college, but I am majoring in BMHS and I was a freshman last semester and I took a lot of the same classes you are going to take!\n\n1. I would definitely recommend looking at material beforehand just to get your brain in the \"zone\" since these classes are pretty hefty. The only classes I didn't take that you are taking are HONR 19901 and PSY 120. I heard that the honors classes aren't terrible and my friend took PSY 120 and said it was an easy A and he barely studied for it. I didn't take it since I got AP credit, but overall I've heard it's not bad at all. For BIOL 110 it's very easy if you have Sean Humphrey. He's an amazing professor, and I would recommend going to his lectures. He prepares you for exams well. Make sure you take notes and study the exam review guides since they're very similar to the actual exams. CHM 115 was difficult for me, but I also hate chemistry so I inevitably struggled. Make sure to do all the practice problems for exams and make sure you know the material well. Read the textbook and do the problems in there. The exams are known to be hard, and they are so knowing the material thoroughly is very important. Going to lecture is a necessity to succeed in the class and paying attention in labs. HSCI 101 is easy. It's mostly guest speakers. I would recommend taking notes on a computer and not hand write them since there's way too much to write it all by hand. Make sure to study for the midterm and final though since the questions are very specific to what the guests talk about on their powerpoints. Also, going to lecture is mandatory and they have a scantron for attendance so you must get there on time and you cannot leave early. MA 16010 was tough for me as well, but math isn't my strong suit. Just make sure to go to lecture and do lots and lots of practice problems and you will be fine. If you ever get lost make sure you get help because it's easy to fall behind and not understand the material since it all builds off the past unit. SOC 100 is a lot of memorization. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine. The exams are mostly just applying information to scenarios. I took it all online though so it might be different in person. \n2. I didn't live in Honors but I knew a few people who did. I will say the rooms are HUGE compared to regular double/triple rooms because the ceilings are a lot higher. Some things I would recommend getting for a dorm that I wish I knew before college were shower shoes (A MUST), enough snacks/bars (i found myself getting hungry on campus and didn't want to go back  to my room), PAPER TOWELS you run out of them faster than you think you will, don't buy dishes just get plastic utensils and paper plates trust me you won't want to do dishes, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I'm more than happy to answer them just feel free to DM me!"}

The only other HONR class worth taking after 19901 and 19902 is the HONR version of ENGL 106. However, if you have credit for that class already don\u2019t bother. I recommend contracting or taking two honors level courses (you get honors credit if there is an \u201cH\u201d at the end of the course CRN) each semester until the end of your sophomore year. Upper division classes are already difficult and professors are less likely to allow you to contract so get all those credits out of the way before you get to any 400 level courses."}

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science).

{"code": "Chm 11600", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE incoming Junior - Open Registration and now I'm REALLY screwed | COMMENT_BODY: Don't worry it's definitely not all lost, there is plenty of stuff you can still take. For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

Orgo is like learning a whole new language, and I found that it is VERY important to have a good understanding of the first few chapters/fundamentals in order to succeed in the rest of the course and future ones.\n\nIf you want to jump the gun, or even if you just want extra practice during the course I highly recommend the book \"Organic Chemistry As a Second Language: First Semester Topics 4th Edition\" by David Klein.  I got it off amazon for like $25 and it was well worth it.  Explains everything thoroughly and in a slightly different way than my prof so I had another way to understand it if her way didn't make sense.  Has practice problems and detailed explanations of each reaction type.\n\nAlso recommend starting a flashcard deck for reactions right away and adding to it throughout the semester, you will have to memorize a LOT of mechanisms.  Oh also the model kit helped me visualize a lot so i recommend one of those but get the one that comes in a box not the shitty bag one from the book store.

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science).

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science).

You might be able to take CS 18000 in the fall semester if there is space after the CS majors sign up, otherwise you will need to wait till spring semester to take it.\n\n**this needs to be an engineering level calc course.

Good luck with your codo, you need like a B+ or higher in a calc, definitely at least an A- in CS 180 and a relatively competitive GPA which I can\u2019t say for sure what that would be but it\u2019ll be pretty realistic with your classes rn tbh. SCLA 101 is busy work, CNIT 180 just study for exams from quizlets they match every semester and the course is as old and outdated as any I\u2019ve taken. Tech 120 is actually brain dead as well.

I think the biggest thing is that in college you\u2019re essentially the one in charge of making sure you\u2019ve done everything and are getting the most out of class so don\u2019t be scared to ask questions and get help. Office hours are gonna be a great help and try to visit your professor\u2019s office hours as well from time to time *especially* if you need help understanding something. You may find that certain strategies/lack there of to not work as well anymore so try to be flexible even if it feels scary. Lastly make sure to get to know a few people who you share classes with and study as a group cause oh man even doing homework as a group helps a lot of people learn better/quicker. Back to your schedule, make sure you\u2019ve got a planner or some sort of system and you should be good. Again, don\u2019t be scared to look like an idiot (as trust me you might feel like one in these stem majors) because at the end of the day you\u2019re learning. If you have time, you can Google these courses and find past semesters\u2019 stuff like notes, hw, exams and kinda look at that and note that people can do absolutely horrible on exams and still get good grades so don\u2019t be bummed out by your scores and stay on top of hw or other things that\u2019ll boost your grade.

A decent amount of quiz questions come from the code on the slides. Also, if you understand everything on the slides and homework you will be fine for the live coding midterms. The first midterm is hard. The average was in the 40-50 range. The second midterm is extremely easy, the average was around 90-100, but they might have been compensating for the first midterm. The homeworks aren't hard at all. The projects should be enough for you to understand all the content. I can't comment on the labs bc there weren't any during COVID-19. \n\nAs far as getting an internship during the school year, very few people do this.

{"code": "Cs 19300", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Is This A Good Schedule For My First Semester? | COMMENT_BODY: First off, getting straight A's is hard. Your schedule is doable, but will be a lot of work.  Calc 3 takes a LOT of time, especially if you are shooting for an A. Additionally, CS 180's projects can be tedious if you do not have a lot of experience. Also, the final project at the end of the semester in 180 will take a significant amount of time. The other 1 credit CS classes are easy. I don't know anything about the DS classes.\n\nIn my opinion, I think 17 is a lot as a first semester freshman bc you are in a completely new environment. It is good to not be stressed and to have extra time to meet friends, go to clubs, etc. If you are trying to get an internship as a freshman, you will have a lot of work upfront in terms of doing a resume, LinkedIn, etc. CS 191 will walk you through the entire process."}

I think the biggest thing is that in college you\u2019re essentially the one in charge of making sure you\u2019ve done everything and are getting the most out of class so don\u2019t be scared to ask questions and get help. Office hours are gonna be a great help and try to visit your professor\u2019s office hours as well from time to time *especially* if you need help understanding something. You may find that certain strategies/lack there of to not work as well anymore so try to be flexible even if it feels scary. Lastly make sure to get to know a few people who you share classes with and study as a group cause oh man even doing homework as a group helps a lot of people learn better/quicker. Back to your schedule, make sure you\u2019ve got a planner or some sort of system and you should be good. Again, don\u2019t be scared to look like an idiot (as trust me you might feel like one in these stem majors) because at the end of the day you\u2019re learning. If you have time, you can Google these courses and find past semesters\u2019 stuff like notes, hw, exams and kinda look at that and note that people can do absolutely horrible on exams and still get good grades so don\u2019t be bummed out by your scores and stay on top of hw or other things that\u2019ll boost your grade. If it\u2019s possible I\u2019d either push MA 261 back a semester but I think your schedule is pretty good.

A decent amount of quiz questions come from the code on the slides. Also, if you understand everything on the slides and homework you will be fine for the live coding midterms. The first midterm is hard. The average was in the 40-50 range. The second midterm is extremely easy, the average was around 90-100, but they might have been compensating for the first midterm. The homeworks aren't hard at all. The projects should be enough for you to understand all the content. I can't comment on the labs bc there weren't any during COVID-19. \n\nAs far as getting an internship during the school year, very few people do this.

{"code": "Cs 42200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Any physics majors willing to answer a couple questions? | COMMENT_BODY: Hello there.  I'm going to be a senior this coming fall and will double major in physics and mathematics.  I believe I may have some helpful tips for you.\n\nTo do meaningful, relevant research in physics, you would definitely need to earn a Ph.D.  Most of the physics material one has to learn to participate in some of today's hot-button research is taught at graduate schools.  But this is doable!  Don't let this amount of schooling (which is usually six more years after Purdue) intimidate you.  If you truly are passionate about physics, spending just a couple more years at a university would be no obstacle.\n\nBut I must note that you do not have to major in physics to be accepted into a physics graduate program.  Actually, having a major in CS would be quite valuable.  Most physics students (at least at Purdue) leave with not much experience with coding and simulating.  And much of the undergraduate research opportunities here require lots of coding!  Your passion for computer science would help you stand out from the crowd.\n\nAlso, double majoring in physics and computer science is perfect for the buzzing research field called **Quantum Computing**.  I encourage you to explore the details and implications of this topic.  It is worthy to note that the Purdue Quantum Center is a wonderful and fulfilling group that has a strong focus in quantum computing.  It is known to have participating undergraduate researchers helping out in any way they can.\n\nAnd for your track to graduation, I'm sure it will work out.  I recommend talking with your advisor as well as the undergraduate physics advisor Janice Thomaz."}
{"code": "Cs 42200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Any physics majors willing to answer a couple questions? | COMMENT_BODY: Not a Physics major, but I'll throw my $0.02 in.\n\nSo if your goal is Physics research, you'll probably need a PhD. Which means you need to get into a physics graduate program, which is a lot easier with a Physics major than without. You may be able to overcome having only a minor with some experience researching in a physics lab, which is always an option.\n\nSo none of the courses you listed have 344 as a prereq. (Thanks for linking the pages by the way, that makes it a lot easier).

[CS has tracks where you can specialize somewhat](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/bachelor.html) in the material you learn.

{"code": "Csr 34200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Desperate for an Easier Path to Graduate from CompE | COMMENT_BODY: I respect the honesty in this post because I didn\u2019t want to suffer through CompE by taking the most difficult upper elective classes. I still learned quite a lot in my undergrad and it certainly wasn\u2019t easy, but I definitely tried not to take classes that were either difficult or huge time sinks. Now I\u2019m on track to graduate in December.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice:\n\n1. For senior design, consider taking the EE Senior Design version (ECE 49022). Less requirements than ECE 477 and more flexibility with your project. I\u2019m taking this course at the moment, and most of the work can be done in lab. Lectures are not mandatory. Grading is lenient. Open source software Senior design (ECE 49595) is also another great option.\n\n2. Take ECE 404 over ECE 469. 404 was a decent amount of work, but you learn a ton and understanding computer security is super useful for industry. You learn and program everything in python. 50% HWs and 50% exams. Exams are open ended but going to office hours and reviewing lecture material will set you up well. A TA told me you only fail the class if you don\u2019t try at all. OS is still super important though, which is why I\u2019d still recommend you to take it. 404 is the easier option though. Maybe take 469 over 437? Also, Python > C/C++ lol.\n\n3. Consider taking ECE 461: Software Engineering. You basically work on 2 coding projects in a team of 3-4 people and there\u2019s a final exam (not difficult). You choose your programming languages based on the professors choice. The grading is pretty lenient. Over half the class got As when I took the class Spring 2023. 461 in my opinion is an easier option over 469, 473 and 40862.\n\n4. Consider taking VIP 49720: Senior Part in VIP (2 credits) and ECE 30864: Software Engineering Tools (1 credit) the same semester for 3 credits total of upper CompE electives. Both pretty easy and count as upper CompE electives. You can only take up to 6 credits of special content electives and VIP 49720 would count for 2 of them. I\u2019m taking both right now and I don\u2019t spend too much time on either, so no complaints really.\n\n5. Consider taking ENGL 205: Introduction to Creative Writing for your upper gened. You basically read and write poetry. Was an easy A for me."}

{"code": "Eaps 10600", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: This is a very standard CompE courseload. I'm EE, but I knew many people who did more or less the exact same thing as you, except EAPS 10600. It will be a lot of work, but there are really no easy semesters once you get out of FYE, regardless of your branch of engineering. My advice is to start all 20007 labs the day they are assigned, and to make sure you REALLY understand lectures in 20001 and go to office hours. I had Peroulis for a lecturer and he was a godsend, but I'm not sure if he'll be teaching in the fall, so I recommend using the textbook often for practice. 264 is a slog with Quinn whose homeworks are beastly, but I'm assuming you have Lu for the fall so the workload won't be terrible, just don't make sure you have a really good handle on debugging with gdb and valgrind. I did diffy q at a local university over the summer, so I don't know much about 266 but the general consensus seems to be that it's another Purdue math class rife with the same problems that plagued 261 and 265, so expect to put time into that one. All in all you have a very standard semester, and even though the workload might seem like a lot, you are in the same boat as 70-75% of other ECE sophomores so you'll have plenty of peers to work with and ask for help. Don't get too discouraged, because the material is actually quite interesting if you spend some time with it.\n\nNOTE: 20007 has the workload of a 3-4 credit class packed into a 1-credit class, but everything you do is absolutely fundamental to the major and really gives you a good intro to topics in 20001 and 20002. Just parcel your time well and don't hesitate to go to office hours for circuit debugging, some of the latter labs can be a grind."}
{"code": "Eaps 10600", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: I think that\u2019s a very doable semester. You might find yourself spending the most time in 20001, 20007, and maybe 264. 264 is a bit odd and I can\u2019t definitively say much, even though I took it lol, other than do your work and if there\u2019s extra credit take it. 20007 is a lot of work for just one credit since you have a lab and a report/write-up each week and you will also have a practical and a project of some sort (basically a slightly more intense lab). 20001 should be okay if it\u2019s in person but they usually don\u2019t go heavy into application so homework/quizzes/exams can be tough. I\u2019d recommend reading the textbook from time to time and getting some sort of group together to either study or work on stuff with cause they had to implement such a system cause of how bad we did that semester and it really helped. I\u2019m taking MA 266 rn and it\u2019s pretty simple imo. Overall it is very doable but those 3 ECE classes will probably take up the most time so stay on top of deadlines for the week and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help even if you feel stupid. Oh and 29401 is really easy you just have to do a task or two a week (and yeah you get like a week or two to do them) and you have like a total of three \u201cessays\u201d (I don\u2019t remember which weeks had an essay but if there\u2019s an essay it\u2019s the only task you have to do). Even if you miss some deadlines in 29401 you can still get an A"}

I would like to know of the possibilities of changing from FYEng to something like computer science as a major (since its not in the school of engineering).  Additionally, is computer engineering at purdue sufficient to apply for CS jobs such as software engineering?\n\n2.  What are the possibilities of doing an engineering+science double major at Purdue?  I really want to do either ECE + Math or CS + Math.  \n3.  I have bunch of credits (calc I/II, phys 172/272, econ 210).  Next year my advisor told me to choose four courses: multivar calc, ENGR 131, ENGL 106, and humanities course totalling up to 13 credits.  I signed up for CS 180 making it 17 credits.  If not CS180, what other types or course do you advise me to take?\n\nI know most of these questions are those my advisor can help me with, but I would like opinions from alums/older students as well.  Looking forward to your responses.  Thanks."}

With the first two, you might have some free time during your shift to get work done, but that also makes those jobs competitive (at least when I was there).\n\nPersonally, I worked at the Cary Knight Spot my freshmen and sophomore years and I did not regret it. They work around your class schedule, as I sometimes had 7:30am classes, so they did not schedule me for the closing shifts that go until 2am. You may have to work on Sundays as those are its busiest days (Dining courts are closed Sundays for dinner), but if you have a religious obligation on Sundays, tell them beforehand.\n\nI personally liked it more than working in the dining courts. I worked at one of the courts for a week and hated it since I felt that all I did was run back and forth between the kitchen and serving area with trays of food. There was something rewarding about putting together an entire meal for someone (as weird as that sounds, and even though it was mostly fast food). You also get a 20 minute break and a meal every shift, so you can be on a smaller dining plan.\n\nIt's a minimum wage job, but when you're working 10-15 hours a week, living in the dorms with little to no bills to pay, that extra money comes in handy.

I am an Honors Engineering student - about to start sophomore year in AAE. There is not a two-year live in commitment and the one year where you are living with the other Honors students is a HUGE benefit... which leads me to my main point. The biggest difference between Honors and non-Honors in engineering is Honors takes ENGR 141/142 their freshman year while non-Honors takes 131/132. The Honors course is SIGNIFICANTLY harder and incredibly time consuming. Not exaggerating, minimum of 15 hrs of work a week outside of class... some weeks pushing 30 when projects are due soon. Living with all the 141/142 students in one building is an incredible resource especially since almost 50% of the class is done in 4-person teams. That all being said, do not be scared away by anything I just said. There is an incredible sense of accomplishment for completing this course and you gain IMMEDIATE street cred on campus when it comes up in conversation that you took that class. In fact, the class is so legendary in rigor, that employers at job fairs sometimes know about it! Leads to great stories in job interviews... which is a huge benefit! I would have been totally screwed in some interviews if it weren't for that class. Glad it's over but worth it! To further spread this message, I'll actually be TA'ing for the course this year."}

Most likely he will stay where he has already signed, be it dorms or apartments, or other.  \n\n>How often will he be gone at the frat during the year?\n\nThat depends as well, and mainly on your roomate and what tiem of the year it is.  He will be over there for mandatory events such as but not limited to: rush, all house meetings, officer meetings, social events, philanthropic events, and any other meeting or commitee or obligation he has.  Another reason he may be there is for personal reasons.

If you never \"lived in\" you would be an \"out of house brother\".  Different houses have different requirements on how long you have to \"live in\" and that may influence your decision.  \n\n\n\nLast, but not least, look at all of the options.

The krannert website has the date for for when non-majors can register for upper level Econ courses. I'm not sure if the policy changes for a minor. Since you're a freshman, don't worry too much if the sections are full, since you'll have 5 more chances. If you somehow still haven't gotten in by your senior year, I'm sure they'll make an exception if you explain your case. You could try emailing the department official in charge of overrides and CC'ing your advisor, but you'll probably get told to wait.

Things like Kirchhoff's Laws, phasors, semiconductor devices, and electromagnetics are prominent in many upper level courses and it is expected that you have a good understanding of this material. However, it is more common than you'd think for students to retake ECE courses and still graduate on time and with a good GPA. At this point, I think you need to evaluate what your passion is, and whether your idea of passion is contingent upon you doing well, because trust me on this, no matter what field you choose, there will always be roadblocks and obstacles that will make you feel demoralized and unmotivated. If you think that by CODOing you will avoid failure, then that's just not the case because every STEM major at Purdue is rigorous and challenging. However, if you really believe that CODOing will allow you to explore something that you genuinely enjoy and can see yourself doing for the rest of your career, then it's worth looking into. Don't make decisions just because you are afraid of failing, as you have no way of predicting what will happen."}

I'm EE, but I knew many people who did more or less the exact same thing as you, except EAPS 10600. It will be a lot of work, but there are really no easy semesters once you get out of FYE, regardless of your branch of engineering. My advice is to start all 20007 labs the day they are assigned, and to make sure you REALLY understand lectures in 20001 and go to office hours. I had Peroulis for a lecturer and he was a godsend, but I'm not sure if he'll be teaching in the fall, so I recommend using the textbook often for practice. 264 is a slog with Quinn whose homeworks are beastly, but I'm assuming you have Lu for the fall so the workload won't be terrible, just don't make sure you have a really good handle on debugging with gdb and valgrind. I did diffy q at a local university over the summer, so I don't know much about 266 but the general consensus seems to be that it's another Purdue math class rife with the same problems that plagued 261 and 265, so expect to put time into that one. All in all you have a very standard semester, and even though the workload might seem like a lot, you are in the same boat as 70-75% of other ECE sophomores so you'll have plenty of peers to work with and ask for help. Don't get too discouraged, because the material is actually quite interesting if you spend some time with it.\n\nNOTE: 20007 has the workload of a 3-4 credit class packed into a 1-credit class, but everything you do is absolutely fundamental to the major and really gives you a good intro to topics in 20001 and 20002. Just parcel your time well and don't hesitate to go to office hours for circuit debugging, some of the latter labs can be a grind."}

ME 200 is a lot of work in a difficult subject area, ECE 20001/20007 take way too much time and is also very difficult. This would be one of the most difficult semesters you could probably take. I would honestly suggest following the ME plan of study map on the course webpage because that helps to ease the semesters a little bit. Also taking PHYS 241 over the summer is the better option it is significantly easier than during the Fall Semester. ME 270 isn't too bad but it's honestly easier when you have a bunch of people that you can work with. Also, try to talk to an ME advisor because they are very helpful in making sure you take all the classes you need while still maintaining some sanity.

So basically i took the lab alone without the lecture the next semester, and i saw your edit so here's my take. I know its not the exact same but i figure its somewhat similar. Wasn't too bad, and i will say that the labs are mostly self-reliant, they explain what you need to know in the manual. If you have a good partner and you understand the material too, you'll be fine imo. Now its not ideal, because the TA moreso reviews the lecture concepts than teaches them, but again between your partner and the TA i think if you do well in 20001 you shouldn't have problems. Not sure about summer 20001 though, i know its already a hard class and summer might be even harder.

{"code": "Ece 20002", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: CODO After Failing | COMMENT_BODY: As a senior in EE, the concepts you learn and are introduced to in 2k1 are foundational to the rest of the major. Things like Kirchhoff's Laws, phasors, semiconductor devices, and electromagnetics are prominent in many upper level courses and it is expected that you have a good understanding of this material. However, it is more common than you'd think for students to retake ECE courses and still graduate on time and with a good GPA. At this point, I think you need to evaluate what your passion is, and whether your idea of passion is contingent upon you doing well, because trust me on this, no matter what field you choose, there will always be roadblocks and obstacles that will make you feel demoralized and unmotivated. If you think that by CODOing you will avoid failure, then that's just not the case because every STEM major at Purdue is rigorous and challenging. However, if you really believe that CODOing will allow you to explore something that you genuinely enjoy and can see yourself doing for the rest of your career, then it's worth looking into.

Ive never done nodal analysis or mesh circuits or any of that circuit analysis since.  And its definitely not a defining moment in your time in ECE.  There are so many different electives later on, EE is a very broad major.

Capano can say and do some really out there stuff whereas Jung does not. Both are about even when it comes to explanations. \n\nOne thing to take into consideration is that Capano only used about 2/3 of assigned class periods. We did not have Friday classes and the TA taught on Mondays, so you really are only getting taught one day out of three by the professor. Lectures were completely online so you didn\u2019t necessarily get behind, but you didn\u2019t get as much time in class as other sections of the class. \n\nAlso, lectures are completely online and done ahead of time. The professors switch off midway through the semester (which is a huge pain in the ass).

{"code": "Ece 20007", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: This is a very standard CompE courseload. I'm EE, but I knew many people who did more or less the exact same thing as you, except EAPS 10600. It will be a lot of work, but there are really no easy semesters once you get out of FYE, regardless of your branch of engineering. My advice is to start all 20007 labs the day they are assigned, and to make sure you REALLY understand lectures in 20001 and go to office hours. I had Peroulis for a lecturer and he was a godsend, but I'm not sure if he'll be teaching in the fall, so I recommend using the textbook often for practice. 264 is a slog with Quinn whose homeworks are beastly, but I'm assuming you have Lu for the fall so the workload won't be terrible, just don't make sure you have a really good handle on debugging with gdb and valgrind. I did diffy q at a local university over the summer, so I don't know much about 266 but the general consensus seems to be that it's another Purdue math class rife with the same problems that plagued 261 and 265, so expect to put time into that one. All in all you have a very standard semester, and even though the workload might seem like a lot, you are in the same boat as 70-75% of other ECE sophomores so you'll have plenty of peers to work with and ask for help. Don't get too discouraged, because the material is actually quite interesting if you spend some time with it.\n\nNOTE: 20007 has the workload of a 3-4 credit class packed into a 1-credit class, but everything you do is absolutely fundamental to the major and really gives you a good intro to topics in 20001 and 20002. Just parcel your time well and don't hesitate to go to office hours for circuit debugging, some of the latter labs can be a grind."}

Wasn't too bad, and i will say that the labs are mostly self-reliant, they explain what you need to know in the manual. If you have a good partner and you understand the material too, you'll be fine imo. Now its not ideal, because the TA moreso reviews the lecture concepts than teaches them, but again between your partner and the TA i think if you do well in 20001 you shouldn't have problems. Not sure about summer 20001 though, i know its already a hard class and summer might be even harder.

Also, take a look at how this will impact you in the long run. It seems like in a severe case you could end up taking one extra semester to graduate. While that\u2019s not ideal, it could help you spread out your major classes and result in you getting better grades with less stress. \n\nAs far as adding in electives, the minor programs at Purdue have some phenomenal classes. The dance department welcomes all skill levels including adults who have never taken any movement classes. Bowling is a class I\u2019ve heard really good things about. If you\u2019re looking for something more related to your major but with less stress, find your favorite professor and see if an independent study would be possible. \n\nYou are going to get through this!

{"code": "Ece 20700", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE incoming Junior - Open Registration and now I'm REALLY screwed | COMMENT_BODY: Don't worry it's definitely not all lost, there is plenty of stuff you can still take. For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

For example, it\u2019s likely that had you done the additional advising appointment, the classes may have still been full. Some classes are just really hard to get into. Also, take a look at how this will impact you in the long run. It seems like in a severe case you could end up taking one extra semester to graduate. While that\u2019s not ideal, it could help you spread out your major classes and result in you getting better grades with less stress. \n\nAs far as adding in electives, the minor programs at Purdue have some phenomenal classes. The dance department welcomes all skill levels including adults who have never taken any movement classes. Bowling is a class I\u2019ve heard really good things about. If you\u2019re looking for something more related to your major but with less stress, find your favorite professor and see if an independent study would be possible. \n\nYou are going to get through this!

{"code": "Ece 20875", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE incoming Junior - Open Registration and now I'm REALLY screwed | COMMENT_BODY: Don't worry it's definitely not all lost, there is plenty of stuff you can still take. For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

People usually take 270 after 2k7 because 2k7 is essentially the intro to circuit building course that teaches you all the basics. If you have no previous knowledge about circuit building/design I would not take 270 since it will use stuff most people only learn about in 2k7.\n\nECE 369 and 270 don't have any relation that would limit you from taking one or the other at the same time. I took ECE 369 and found it to be pretty easy (from someone who struggled through every other math class), I think it depends on the professor but mine had lots of extra credit and an A was like 85% I think.\n\nUltimately I would recommend switching out 270 for a Gen-Ed, unless you already have a lot of breadboard experience from somewhere and know Verilog pretty well. If you stick with it just know that you will have 2 huge 3 hour labs taking up your time each week so you might not even be able to take all these classes due to limitations on when certain classes are scheduled (i.e. some classes are only one lecture at a specific time and another class might only fit at that same time as well)."}

{"code": "Ece 26400", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: This is a very standard CompE courseload. I'm EE, but I knew many people who did more or less the exact same thing as you, except EAPS 10600. It will be a lot of work, but there are really no easy semesters once you get out of FYE, regardless of your branch of engineering. My advice is to start all 20007 labs the day they are assigned, and to make sure you REALLY understand lectures in 20001 and go to office hours. I had Peroulis for a lecturer and he was a godsend, but I'm not sure if he'll be teaching in the fall, so I recommend using the textbook often for practice. 264 is a slog with Quinn whose homeworks are beastly, but I'm assuming you have Lu for the fall so the workload won't be terrible, just don't make sure you have a really good handle on debugging with gdb and valgrind. I did diffy q at a local university over the summer, so I don't know much about 266 but the general consensus seems to be that it's another Purdue math class rife with the same problems that plagued 261 and 265, so expect to put time into that one. All in all you have a very standard semester, and even though the workload might seem like a lot, you are in the same boat as 70-75% of other ECE sophomores so you'll have plenty of peers to work with and ask for help. Don't get too discouraged, because the material is actually quite interesting if you spend some time with it.\n\nNOTE: 20007 has the workload of a 3-4 credit class packed into a 1-credit class, but everything you do is absolutely fundamental to the major and really gives you a good intro to topics in 20001 and 20002. Just parcel your time well and don't hesitate to go to office hours for circuit debugging, some of the latter labs can be a grind."}
{"code": "Ece 26400", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: I think that\u2019s a very doable semester. You might find yourself spending the most time in 20001, 20007, and maybe 264. 264 is a bit odd and I can\u2019t definitively say much, even though I took it lol, other than do your work and if there\u2019s extra credit take it. 20007 is a lot of work for just one credit since you have a lab and a report/write-up each week and you will also have a practical and a project of some sort (basically a slightly more intense lab). 20001 should be okay if it\u2019s in person but they usually don\u2019t go heavy into application so homework/quizzes/exams can be tough. I\u2019d recommend reading the textbook from time to time and getting some sort of group together to either study or work on stuff with cause they had to implement such a system cause of how bad we did that semester and it really helped. I\u2019m taking MA 266 rn and it\u2019s pretty simple imo. Overall it is very doable but those 3 ECE classes will probably take up the most time so stay on top of deadlines for the week and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help even if you feel stupid. Oh and 29401 is really easy you just have to do a task or two a week (and yeah you get like a week or two to do them) and you have like a total of three \u201cessays\u201d (I don\u2019t remember which weeks had an essay but if there\u2019s an essay it\u2019s the only task you have to do).

Architecture work requires lots of experience. I would say ms is doable if you just want to work on the architecture team. For example, at ARM the architecture team definitely hires people with just an ms. Even some with bs were given interviews. However, you will probably need lots of experience or/and higher education at some point in your career to be considered qualified as an architect.

I interned at AMD as a master's student and while they talked a lot about how degrees don't matter, all but one of the architects I met had a PhD. \n\nI took 568 last spring. The lectures are good but I felt like the labs were rushed, lacking, and didn't offer much practical preparation for applying to embedded jobs.

{"code": "Ece 29401", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: This is a very standard CompE courseload. I'm EE, but I knew many people who did more or less the exact same thing as you, except EAPS 10600. It will be a lot of work, but there are really no easy semesters once you get out of FYE, regardless of your branch of engineering. My advice is to start all 20007 labs the day they are assigned, and to make sure you REALLY understand lectures in 20001 and go to office hours. I had Peroulis for a lecturer and he was a godsend, but I'm not sure if he'll be teaching in the fall, so I recommend using the textbook often for practice. 264 is a slog with Quinn whose homeworks are beastly, but I'm assuming you have Lu for the fall so the workload won't be terrible, just don't make sure you have a really good handle on debugging with gdb and valgrind. I did diffy q at a local university over the summer, so I don't know much about 266 but the general consensus seems to be that it's another Purdue math class rife with the same problems that plagued 261 and 265, so expect to put time into that one. All in all you have a very standard semester, and even though the workload might seem like a lot, you are in the same boat as 70-75% of other ECE sophomores so you'll have plenty of peers to work with and ask for help. Don't get too discouraged, because the material is actually quite interesting if you spend some time with it.\n\nNOTE: 20007 has the workload of a 3-4 credit class packed into a 1-credit class, but everything you do is absolutely fundamental to the major and really gives you a good intro to topics in 20001 and 20002. Just parcel your time well and don't hesitate to go to office hours for circuit debugging, some of the latter labs can be a grind."}
{"code": "Ece 29401", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: I think that\u2019s a very doable semester. You might find yourself spending the most time in 20001, 20007, and maybe 264. 264 is a bit odd and I can\u2019t definitively say much, even though I took it lol, other than do your work and if there\u2019s extra credit take it. 20007 is a lot of work for just one credit since you have a lab and a report/write-up each week and you will also have a practical and a project of some sort (basically a slightly more intense lab). 20001 should be okay if it\u2019s in person but they usually don\u2019t go heavy into application so homework/quizzes/exams can be tough. I\u2019d recommend reading the textbook from time to time and getting some sort of group together to either study or work on stuff with cause they had to implement such a system cause of how bad we did that semester and it really helped. I\u2019m taking MA 266 rn and it\u2019s pretty simple imo.

For example, it\u2019s likely that had you done the additional advising appointment, the classes may have still been full. Some classes are just really hard to get into. Also, take a look at how this will impact you in the long run. It seems like in a severe case you could end up taking one extra semester to graduate. While that\u2019s not ideal, it could help you spread out your major classes and result in you getting better grades with less stress. \n\nAs far as adding in electives, the minor programs at Purdue have some phenomenal classes. The dance department welcomes all skill levels including adults who have never taken any movement classes. Bowling is a class I\u2019ve heard really good things about. If you\u2019re looking for something more related to your major but with less stress, find your favorite professor and see if an independent study would be possible. \n\nYou are going to get through this!

{"code": "Ece 30100", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE incoming Junior - Open Registration and now I'm REALLY screwed | COMMENT_BODY: Don't worry it's definitely not all lost, there is plenty of stuff you can still take. For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

You have to pay to keep track of multiple classes for one semester (you can keep track of one class for free), but it was worth it because I got into the classes I wanted.

For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

If you stick with it just know that you will have 2 huge 3 hour labs taking up your time each week so you might not even be able to take all these classes due to limitations on when certain classes are scheduled (i.e. some classes are only one lecture at a specific time and another class might only fit at that same time as well)."}

{"code": "Ece 39401", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Desperate for an Easier Path to Graduate from CompE | COMMENT_BODY: I respect the honesty in this post because I didn\u2019t want to suffer through CompE by taking the most difficult upper elective classes. I still learned quite a lot in my undergrad and it certainly wasn\u2019t easy, but I definitely tried not to take classes that were either difficult or huge time sinks. Now I\u2019m on track to graduate in December.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice:\n\n1. For senior design, consider taking the EE Senior Design version (ECE 49022). Less requirements than ECE 477 and more flexibility with your project. I\u2019m taking this course at the moment, and most of the work can be done in lab. Lectures are not mandatory. Grading is lenient. Open source software Senior design (ECE 49595) is also another great option.\n\n2. Take ECE 404 over ECE 469. 404 was a decent amount of work, but you learn a ton and understanding computer security is super useful for industry. You learn and program everything in python. 50% HWs and 50% exams. Exams are open ended but going to office hours and reviewing lecture material will set you up well. A TA told me you only fail the class if you don\u2019t try at all. OS is still super important though, which is why I\u2019d still recommend you to take it. 404 is the easier option though. Maybe take 469 over 437? Also, Python > C/C++ lol.\n\n3. Consider taking ECE 461: Software Engineering. You basically work on 2 coding projects in a team of 3-4 people and there\u2019s a final exam (not difficult). You choose your programming languages based on the professors choice. The grading is pretty lenient. Over half the class got As when I took the class Spring 2023. 461 in my opinion is an easier option over 469, 473 and 40862.\n\n4. Consider taking VIP 49720: Senior Part in VIP (2 credits) and ECE 30864: Software Engineering Tools (1 credit) the same semester for 3 credits total of upper CompE electives. Both pretty easy and count as upper CompE electives. You can only take up to 6 credits of special content electives and VIP 49720 would count for 2 of them. I\u2019m taking both right now and I don\u2019t spend too much time on either, so no complaints really.\n\n5. Consider taking ENGL 205: Introduction to Creative Writing for your upper gened. You basically read and write poetry. Was an easy A for me."}

For example, at ARM the architecture team definitely hires people with just an ms. Even some with bs were given interviews.

The lectures are good but I felt like the labs were rushed, lacking, and didn't offer much practical preparation for applying to embedded jobs.

Avi doesn't touch any of that stuff so if the GTA decides to make the homeworks unbearable that's up to them. However, I think they are traditionally pretty standard and for me didn't take any longer than 2/3 hours a week to complete. They're also in Python - no more C :) Avi requires mandatory attendance at his lectures which were 2 evening power hours a week when I took it. You take a 3 minute quiz at the beginning of class which aren't technically graded but Avi will go off on rants if the answers are ridiculously incorrect or left totally blank.

{"code": "Ece 40862", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Desperate for an Easier Path to Graduate from CompE | COMMENT_BODY: I respect the honesty in this post because I didn\u2019t want to suffer through CompE by taking the most difficult upper elective classes. I still learned quite a lot in my undergrad and it certainly wasn\u2019t easy, but I definitely tried not to take classes that were either difficult or huge time sinks. Now I\u2019m on track to graduate in December.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice:\n\n1. For senior design, consider taking the EE Senior Design version (ECE 49022). Less requirements than ECE 477 and more flexibility with your project. I\u2019m taking this course at the moment, and most of the work can be done in lab. Lectures are not mandatory. Grading is lenient. Open source software Senior design (ECE 49595) is also another great option.\n\n2. Take ECE 404 over ECE 469. 404 was a decent amount of work, but you learn a ton and understanding computer security is super useful for industry. You learn and program everything in python. 50% HWs and 50% exams. Exams are open ended but going to office hours and reviewing lecture material will set you up well. A TA told me you only fail the class if you don\u2019t try at all. OS is still super important though, which is why I\u2019d still recommend you to take it. 404 is the easier option though. Maybe take 469 over 437? Also, Python > C/C++ lol.\n\n3. Consider taking ECE 461: Software Engineering. You basically work on 2 coding projects in a team of 3-4 people and there\u2019s a final exam (not difficult). You choose your programming languages based on the professors choice. The grading is pretty lenient. Over half the class got As when I took the class Spring 2023. 461 in my opinion is an easier option over 469, 473 and 40862.\n\n4. Consider taking VIP 49720: Senior Part in VIP (2 credits) and ECE 30864: Software Engineering Tools (1 credit) the same semester for 3 credits total of upper CompE electives. Both pretty easy and count as upper CompE electives. You can only take up to 6 credits of special content electives and VIP 49720 would count for 2 of them. I\u2019m taking both right now and I don\u2019t spend too much time on either, so no complaints really.\n\n5. Consider taking ENGL 205: Introduction to Creative Writing for your upper gened. You basically read and write poetry. Was an easy A for me."}

I was planning to take 468 or 573 (compilers) until I researched the professor more. They seem to really foul the experience for most people, so I dropped it. Use your own judgement here. I think compilers theory is important for SWE to only a mild extent. You very well may be able to self research enough for interviews without suffering this course.\n\n5.) I took SET last semester. Pretty painful experience, but I am not SWE. The course is not taught exceedingly well (taught by a grad student), so most of your learning will be done individually through prelabs every week. These take a while. I spent perhaps five to ten hours a week on each one, with some weeks far exceeding that. However, this is probably a fairly important course to take for SWE, so I would say take it.\n\n6.) Not gonna comment on the seminar or general eds.

It\u2019s like 264 vs 368 (which I guess you haven\u2019t taken yet either). In 264 you have to write functional code that doesn\u2019t leak memory. In 368 your code needs to function.

One gets assigned to you by the course staff. I don't have any experience with EPICS directly but from what I've heard from friends their experiences have been less than stellar.\n\nIn my opinion ECE 477 is the best choice of them all because you get to choose your own project, your own team members and the course staff is super friendly.

The boards are about $12 each, so buy one yourself if your curious about it. The hardest part is dealing with TI's IDE, Code Composer Studio. They normally don't run an operating system, you just write your own code to run.\n\nHowever, we assign you into a group, and usually there is only one person of of the three to five that is doing microcontroller programming. So, it's likely that you would be doing something other than microcontrollers.\n\nThere are a few teams that get to do special projects, which could be more interesting than the \"standard project\" that the rest of the class is doing. But, if you do the standard project, you can usually ask your TA to make changes to the project to make it more interesting to you.\n\nWe have six hours of lab time per week, and if you can commit to working another 5-10 hours a week outside of lab, you can be fairly relaxed.

{"code": "Ece 49401", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Desperate for an Easier Path to Graduate from CompE | COMMENT_BODY: I respect the honesty in this post because I didn\u2019t want to suffer through CompE by taking the most difficult upper elective classes. I still learned quite a lot in my undergrad and it certainly wasn\u2019t easy, but I definitely tried not to take classes that were either difficult or huge time sinks. Now I\u2019m on track to graduate in December.\n\nHere\u2019s my advice:\n\n1. For senior design, consider taking the EE Senior Design version (ECE 49022). Less requirements than ECE 477 and more flexibility with your project. I\u2019m taking this course at the moment, and most of the work can be done in lab. Lectures are not mandatory. Grading is lenient. Open source software Senior design (ECE 49595) is also another great option.\n\n2. Take ECE 404 over ECE 469. 404 was a decent amount of work, but you learn a ton and understanding computer security is super useful for industry. You learn and program everything in python. 50% HWs and 50% exams. Exams are open ended but going to office hours and reviewing lecture material will set you up well. A TA told me you only fail the class if you don\u2019t try at all. OS is still super important though, which is why I\u2019d still recommend you to take it. 404 is the easier option though. Maybe take 469 over 437? Also, Python > C/C++ lol.\n\n3. Consider taking ECE 461: Software Engineering. You basically work on 2 coding projects in a team of 3-4 people and there\u2019s a final exam (not difficult). You choose your programming languages based on the professors choice. The grading is pretty lenient. Over half the class got As when I took the class Spring 2023. 461 in my opinion is an easier option over 469, 473 and 40862.\n\n4. Consider taking VIP 49720: Senior Part in VIP (2 credits) and ECE 30864: Software Engineering Tools (1 credit) the same semester for 3 credits total of upper CompE electives. Both pretty easy and count as upper CompE electives. You can only take up to 6 credits of special content electives and VIP 49720 would count for 2 of them. I\u2019m taking both right now and I don\u2019t spend too much time on either, so no complaints really.\n\n5. Consider taking ENGL 205: Introduction to Creative Writing for your upper gened. You basically read and write poetry. Was an easy A for me."}

I was planning to take 468 or 573 (compilers) until I researched the professor more. They seem to really foul the experience for most people, so I dropped it. Use your own judgement here. I think compilers theory is important for SWE to only a mild extent. You very well may be able to self research enough for interviews without suffering this course.\n\n5.) I took SET last semester. Pretty painful experience, but I am not SWE. The course is not taught exceedingly well (taught by a grad student), so most of your learning will be done individually through prelabs every week. These take a while. I spent perhaps five to ten hours a week on each one, with some weeks far exceeding that.

I think compilers theory is important for SWE to only a mild extent. You very well may be able to self research enough for interviews without suffering this course.\n\n5.) I took SET last semester. Pretty painful experience, but I am not SWE. The course is not taught exceedingly well (taught by a grad student), so most of your learning will be done individually through prelabs every week. These take a while. I spent perhaps five to ten hours a week on each one, with some weeks far exceeding that. However, this is probably a fairly important course to take for SWE, so I would say take it.\n\n6.) Not gonna comment on the seminar or general eds. As for ECE51220 (applied algorithms), I am taking it next semester and Prof. Koh did say it was easier than 368 (or at least less time consuming) if that means anything to you."}

And if you are going through the trouble of taking those classes, you don\u2019t want to just get by and get them done, you want to really learn the material. Give yourself a little more time. \n\n337, 362, and 368 are all implementation heavy. Maybe if you really want to push, take 264 over the summer instead of 2k2 (swap the two). Push 368 to the fall so you have 2 implementation heavy classes (270, 368) and 369 to the spring. Bonus, Kulkarni MIGHT teach it in the spring and that (imo) would be much better than Givan. If not, it\u2019s still a bit more balanced. Also you\u2019ll have 266 before 2k2 and that\u2019ll help a bit. Still a hard plan but could be doable. It can help pushing 301 by a semester. It really shouldn\u2019t be a prerequisite for 302 and is hardly used (only in the last 1/2 weeks and very little) so don\u2019t worry about taking them together. \n\nAnother thing, if you take 437 after finishing your undergrad, it can count as a grad course (see master\u2019s handbook).

Overall I'd say the class is more for those interested in ME than FYE students as a whole, but the main purpose of ME199 is to give you a chance to see engineering in practice, not to prepare you for whatever discipline you'd like to go into."}

I highly recommend going to TA or Professor office hours if you have any confusion at all with content. \n4. I would wait until you get the course syllabus to do anything about textbooks or even until the first week of classes is over because textbooks are often not entirely necessary.

Personally, I found the 5-subject notebooks to be convenient. Just one notebook with all my class notes, don\u2019t have to worry about grabbing the right notebook on the right day for the right class. Binders can be good if you want to further organize your notes and class material, but I personally don\u2019t like lugging them around in my backpack all day. I liked to use them for keeping them at my desk and studying at home. Some classes required a lot of organization for me, so I had maybe one binder in use. Also, A lot of things are digital now. For every class, you\u2019ll have lecture powerpoints posted online, syllabi, resources, etc all online on Canvas or Blackboard (whatever you guys use now). But you can always print out the PowerPoint notes yourself if you tend to learn better by writing them down and having a physical hard copy in front of you. I liked to use a notepad for class so I could quickly jot down info as we go and then go home, pull up the PowerPoint on my computer and take notes off the PowerPoint while integrating my class notes all into my notebook. \nAnd lots of people will digitally take notes and type their class notes on a google doc and do all their notes organizing on their computer or iPad.\n\nThis is something that might take you some time to figure out and what you like best and what suits each class the best.

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science). For example, if a student with no dual/AP credits has a 3.2+ GPA in MA 161, CHM 115, and ENGL 106, then they will probably get into FYE.

Most of the course is based on various group and individual presentations throughout the semester. The only \"homework\" for the class is outlines and scripts for your presentations. There aren't any exams, but there are quizzes based on assigned reading that are worth maybe 10-15% of your grade. If I remember correctly, quizzes were biweekly and based on the book- really easy if you actually read the 20-30 (regular sized, not textbook) pages that were assigned.\n\nOverall, a pretty easy class without too much work, but you do actually have to do the work that's assigned (and not at the last minute) and follow directions carefully. Obviously, presenting is a big part of it, so if you have trouble with public speaking or writing, you'll have more difficulty with the course."}

See what score Purdue needs for you to get credit for 101, 102, and 201 and study up so you can ideally get your whole foreign language requirement done through CLEP. \n\nLong answer: \nHonestly, you aren\u2019t going to be able to take the advanced level CS classes until after you pass CS 251 anyway. Most CS majors won\u2019t take an advanced class until sophomore spring at the absolute earliest. And your CS and math courses will be at most 11 credits of the 12-16 we would recommend.

It's dead useful obviously save the $ and do less classes at Purdue, probably less of a workload every semester too, but I gotta warn you. As a sophomore, I did a lot of that and I now wish I saved some classes to take here.

That being said, college is a great time to explore diverse interests so if you do want to test out if as much as possible consider using that extra space for a minor or just to get some fun experiences in some experiential classes (ex: flower arranging, wine tasting, dance, art, metalworking, furniture design, etc.)."}

My 2 sense on everything:\n1. It's summer and Purdue is a really hard school. Go like enjoy it while you can. If you REALLY need to study over the summer I would brush up on calculus as that will likely be your hardest class for a while.\n2. Honors contracting courses is really nice because you take a class you have to take anyway and get honors credit for it. If you really want to do an honors class they aren't the worst. Just pick one you like the subject material. If you want to squeeze in some extra credit go on one of the fall break trips. You lose fall break but it's an easy credit.\n3. It's going to be small. There are plenty of lists out there for what to bring but a mattress topper is a God send. Also bring like emergency food like pop tarts. Besides that just Google a list and you should be fine.\nGood luck and boiler up!"}

Typically on the bigger side of the room there\u2019s 2 beds and on the smaller side there\u2019s just the one. When I lived in one i never had problems with space as there was a lot of shared space that we all agreed to just store things at. The room is big enough that we jokingly said we could fit a kiddy pool in the corner, we probably could have.\n\nAdding to that, on google maps there\u2019s a photosphere of an honors triple in north, but the north and south triples should be the same"}

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: Hi! I am in BMHS (pre-med) and I am also in the honors college.\n\n1) HONR 19901 rarely has a textbook - if ever. There are reading a to do but they are provided. I am a mentor and will be a mentor again this year. BIOL 11000 does have a textbook but you can often buy a second hand copy or like get an ebook online. If you DM me I can help you with this. I didn\u2019t take CHM 115 so I can\u2019t comment. HSCI 101 is a class I used to TA for and this class is a bunch of guest lectures - just show up to class on time. I also didn\u2019t take MA16010. I have the textbooks I used for PSY 12000 and SOC 10000 which were the same ones they used this year, so I presume they will use them again. If you DM I can share. Additionally in myPurdue there is a \u201ctextbooks\u201d section where you can go to look at assigned textbooks. I would wait before formally purchasing any because sometimes it\u2019s just a recommended book but not required - and in that case. Don\u2019t waste your money.\n\n2) A lot of your normal classes can be made into honors courses via honors contracting. This often includes writing another paper or doing an extra assignment. I know first hand that contracting BIOL 110 and PSY 120 are extremely easy. I just had to write an extra paper and they were both on topics of my choice. Otherwise HONR 299 courses are great. They change pretty regularly but I really recommend Dean\u2019s Seminar, Learning Across Differences, etc.\n\n3) bring less than what you think you need is my biggest piece of advice. If you want to DM me what your dorm hall is, I can probably get a picture for you. I would also bring storage containers. I think a good rule of thumb that I wish I followed would be 3 storage tubes (decent size ones MAX). One for winter stuff, one for summer/spring/formal stuff (it\u2019s not warm that long anyway), and one for bedding/personal items!\n\nFeel free to ask me anymore questions.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: I wasn't in the honors college, but I am majoring in BMHS and I was a freshman last semester and I took a lot of the same classes you are going to take!\n\n1. I would definitely recommend looking at material beforehand just to get your brain in the \"zone\" since these classes are pretty hefty. The only classes I didn't take that you are taking are HONR 19901 and PSY 120. I heard that the honors classes aren't terrible and my friend took PSY 120 and said it was an easy A and he barely studied for it. I didn't take it since I got AP credit, but overall I've heard it's not bad at all. For BIOL 110 it's very easy if you have Sean Humphrey. He's an amazing professor, and I would recommend going to his lectures. He prepares you for exams well. Make sure you take notes and study the exam review guides since they're very similar to the actual exams. CHM 115 was difficult for me, but I also hate chemistry so I inevitably struggled. Make sure to do all the practice problems for exams and make sure you know the material well. Read the textbook and do the problems in there. The exams are known to be hard, and they are so knowing the material thoroughly is very important. Going to lecture is a necessity to succeed in the class and paying attention in labs. HSCI 101 is easy. It's mostly guest speakers. I would recommend taking notes on a computer and not hand write them since there's way too much to write it all by hand. Make sure to study for the midterm and final though since the questions are very specific to what the guests talk about on their powerpoints. Also, going to lecture is mandatory and they have a scantron for attendance so you must get there on time and you cannot leave early. MA 16010 was tough for me as well, but math isn't my strong suit. Just make sure to go to lecture and do lots and lots of practice problems and you will be fine. If you ever get lost make sure you get help because it's easy to fall behind and not understand the material since it all builds off the past unit. SOC 100 is a lot of memorization. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine. The exams are mostly just applying information to scenarios. I took it all online though so it might be different in person. \n2. I didn't live in Honors but I knew a few people who did. I will say the rooms are HUGE compared to regular double/triple rooms because the ceilings are a lot higher. Some things I would recommend getting for a dorm that I wish I knew before college were shower shoes (A MUST), enough snacks/bars (i found myself getting hungry on campus and didn't want to go back  to my room), PAPER TOWELS you run out of them faster than you think you will, don't buy dishes just get plastic utensils and paper plates trust me you won't want to do dishes, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I'm more than happy to answer them just feel free to DM me!"}

The only other HONR class worth taking after 19901 and 19902 is the HONR version of ENGL 106. However, if you have credit for that class already don\u2019t bother. I recommend contracting or taking two honors level courses (you get honors credit if there is an \u201cH\u201d at the end of the course CRN) each semester until the end of your sophomore year. Upper division classes are already difficult and professors are less likely to allow you to contract so get all those credits out of the way before you get to any 400 level courses."}

The only way to get things out of the way faster would to do ENGR 133 which is only 1 semester, however I do not know enough about that program to tell you if that makes you eligible to T2M immediately following your first semester.\n\n\nEDIT: ENGR 133 is not VIP, it is EPICS.

{"code": "Hist 15200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: AP Credit | COMMENT_BODY: The thing about a lot of the classes (also depends on major) is that a lot of the core classes have to be taken in a specific order and also can't be taken at the same time.

{"code": "Hist 15200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: AP Credit | COMMENT_BODY: I took a bunch of APs, so this first semester I didn\u2019t need to take many of the basic classes. From what I remember my counselor telling me, if you have physics credits, you can take engr 130, which is only one semester, allowing you to T2M after the first semester. However, certain majors don\u2019t allow that (AAE, possibly ME but I can\u2019t remember). You can still take major requirements first/second semester (CS 159, MA261), so you don\u2019t have to do them later."}

A year early in engineering quite literally is unheard of. Almost no one can do that, even with a semester/year of FYE classes out of the way. A semester early is doable, especially if you don\u2019t want to get any minors. \n\nBut honestly I\u2019d just knock out as many AP classes as you can in order to give yourself an easier time at Purdue (or wherever you go) over a normal 4 years. Because of the AP credit I had going in, I got to take several 13-15 credit hour semesters, and only had to do 17 once, even though I came out with minors in math and chemistry"}

I really enjoy EAPS classes so I'm inclined to recommend EAPS 301. The content is pretty interesting, and the professor (james ogg) is super cool. As long as you pay attention in class you're pretty much good. There are quizzes every so often and a couple tests too. I can't remember if we could use our notes or not, I think we did. The one big thing about that class though was a big paper we had to do. I think it had to be about 10 pages long, ish, and it's worth a reasonable chunk. I think I got a D or something on the paper and ended up with a B in the class. I don't remember.\n\nThe section of EAPS 375 I'm in right now is kinda bullcrap. The teacher is brand new and is teaching 4 other classes at the same time. There's a group project/presentation at the end. I mean truthfully it doesn't seem all that bad, I just hate giving presentations and having group projects. I figured it would be some old guy lecturing and you'd be ok if you just paid attention.\n\nAnyway, I think either of those are good choice if you have any interest in oil and/or energy in the history and today and the future.

Honors contracting courses is really nice because you take a class you have to take anyway and get honors credit for it. If you really want to do an honors class they aren't the worst. Just pick one you like the subject material. If you want to squeeze in some extra credit go on one of the fall break trips. You lose fall break but it's an easy credit.\n3. It's going to be small.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: Hi! I am in BMHS (pre-med) and I am also in the honors college.\n\n1) HONR 19901 rarely has a textbook - if ever. There are reading a to do but they are provided. I am a mentor and will be a mentor again this year. BIOL 11000 does have a textbook but you can often buy a second hand copy or like get an ebook online. If you DM me I can help you with this. I didn\u2019t take CHM 115 so I can\u2019t comment. HSCI 101 is a class I used to TA for and this class is a bunch of guest lectures - just show up to class on time. I also didn\u2019t take MA16010. I have the textbooks I used for PSY 12000 and SOC 10000 which were the same ones they used this year, so I presume they will use them again. If you DM I can share. Additionally in myPurdue there is a \u201ctextbooks\u201d section where you can go to look at assigned textbooks. I would wait before formally purchasing any because sometimes it\u2019s just a recommended book but not required - and in that case. Don\u2019t waste your money.\n\n2) A lot of your normal classes can be made into honors courses via honors contracting. This often includes writing another paper or doing an extra assignment. I know first hand that contracting BIOL 110 and PSY 120 are extremely easy. I just had to write an extra paper and they were both on topics of my choice. Otherwise HONR 299 courses are great. They change pretty regularly but I really recommend Dean\u2019s Seminar, Learning Across Differences, etc.\n\n3) bring less than what you think you need is my biggest piece of advice. If you want to DM me what your dorm hall is, I can probably get a picture for you. I would also bring storage containers. I think a good rule of thumb that I wish I followed would be 3 storage tubes (decent size ones MAX). One for winter stuff, one for summer/spring/formal stuff (it\u2019s not warm that long anyway), and one for bedding/personal items!\n\nFeel free to ask me anymore questions.

I would definitely recommend looking at material beforehand just to get your brain in the \"zone\" since these classes are pretty hefty. The only classes I didn't take that you are taking are HONR 19901 and PSY 120. I heard that the honors classes aren't terrible and my friend took PSY 120 and said it was an easy A and he barely studied for it. I didn't take it since I got AP credit, but overall I've heard it's not bad at all. For BIOL 110 it's very easy if you have Sean Humphrey. He's an amazing professor, and I would recommend going to his lectures. He prepares you for exams well. Make sure you take notes and study the exam review guides since they're very similar to the actual exams. CHM 115 was difficult for me, but I also hate chemistry so I inevitably struggled. Make sure to do all the practice problems for exams and make sure you know the material well. Read the textbook and do the problems in there. The exams are known to be hard, and they are so knowing the material thoroughly is very important. Going to lecture is a necessity to succeed in the class and paying attention in labs. HSCI 101 is easy. It's mostly guest speakers. I would recommend taking notes on a computer and not hand write them since there's way too much to write it all by hand. Make sure to study for the midterm and final though since the questions are very specific to what the guests talk about on their powerpoints. Also, going to lecture is mandatory and they have a scantron for attendance so you must get there on time and you cannot leave early. MA 16010 was tough for me as well, but math isn't my strong suit. Just make sure to go to lecture and do lots and lots of practice problems and you will be fine. If you ever get lost make sure you get help because it's easy to fall behind and not understand the material since it all builds off the past unit. SOC 100 is a lot of memorization. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine. The exams are mostly just applying information to scenarios. I took it all online though so it might be different in person. \n2. I didn't live in Honors but I knew a few people who did. I will say the rooms are HUGE compared to regular double/triple rooms because the ceilings are a lot higher. Some things I would recommend getting for a dorm that I wish I knew before college were shower shoes (A MUST), enough snacks/bars (i found myself getting hungry on campus and didn't want to go back  to my room), PAPER TOWELS you run out of them faster than you think you will, don't buy dishes just get plastic utensils and paper plates trust me you won't want to do dishes, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I'm more than happy to answer them just feel free to DM me!"}

I recommend contracting or taking two honors level courses (you get honors credit if there is an \u201cH\u201d at the end of the course CRN) each semester until the end of your sophomore year. Upper division classes are already difficult and professors are less likely to allow you to contract so get all those credits out of the way before you get to any 400 level courses."}

I really enjoy EAPS classes so I'm inclined to recommend EAPS 301. The content is pretty interesting, and the professor (james ogg) is super cool. As long as you pay attention in class you're pretty much good. There are quizzes every so often and a couple tests too. I can't remember if we could use our notes or not, I think we did. The one big thing about that class though was a big paper we had to do. I think it had to be about 10 pages long, ish, and it's worth a reasonable chunk. I think I got a D or something on the paper and ended up with a B in the class. I don't remember.\n\nThe section of EAPS 375 I'm in right now is kinda bullcrap. The teacher is brand new and is teaching 4 other classes at the same time. There's a group project/presentation at the end. I mean truthfully it doesn't seem all that bad, I just hate giving presentations and having group projects. I figured it would be some old guy lecturing and you'd be ok if you just paid attention.\n\nAnyway, I think either of those are good choice if you have any interest in oil and/or energy in the history and today and the future. I think it's pretty valuable to think about."}

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science).

IMO, 25501 is extremely easy, but poorly run. 270 is hard, but poorly run. These are your core classes though, so you should take these both this semester, and probably take 242, 272, and 280 next semester. SOC 100 and SOC 220 are very easy for your BSS. MA 16020 is pretty hard if you don't like math from what I heard, so I just took MATH202 at IVY Tech and it was dummy easy. MGMT200 was easy, but more time consuming than TLI112, which was dummy easy. Overall, this would be an absolutely doable schedule."}

{"code": "Mgmt 20000", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: What should I do to prepare for my spring courses | COMMENT_BODY: MA 16010: I just finished taking this. My biggest tip is to stay on top of the homework. There is a homework set (usually between 5-12 problems) assigned after each lecture and due the evening of the next lecture (ex: Monday lecture, homework on that lecture is due Wednesday night). Homework isn't too bad, but don't fall behind. If you don't like your instructor, all of the videos from other instructors are available so you can find one that works best for you. \n\nECON 251: I had no microeconomics experience before I took this class. Kelly Blanchard is a pretty good professor. That being said, I didn't like this class. Wasn't overly interesting to me. There were a lot of topics that when I learned them, they didn't make sense and I got frustrated. As you move along in the class, though, you have to apply those topics and build on them so you practice them and they become easier to understand. So just hang in there. Homeworks have unlimited attempts, so that's a fairly easy set of points."}

I don\u2019t think every teacher gave that out and idk how it will be online, but I think I saved all the past exam practice on my computer if you need it feel free to message me.

Homework is unlimited attempts and honestly pretty easy (only 10 problems I think for each?). I\u2019d never taken any kind of economics and ended with a high B because I didn\u2019t put it much effort (I took this and halfway through I changed to a major that this wouldn\u2019t matter for). I don\u2019t remember how tough exams were but I typically remember exams that I found difficult, so these weren\u2019t hard enough to make an impression at least.\n\nMA 16010: I had no previous calculus experience. I feel like a lot of this class depends on who is teaching it to you. My classmates who did have previous calc experience even had a hard time with my TA (they would often catch her mistakes when she was teaching and on quizzes so I wouldn\u2019t say I had a great experience trying to learn from her) and I was lost af and still ended with a C somehow. Stay on top of the homework. It\u2019s really not much per assignment, just a lot of assignments (like 3 a week). I think vids are available from every instructor and I heard other instructors were better than mine so utilize that if need be.\n\nMGMT 200: I had Terra Maienbrook. I wasn\u2019t super interested in accounting but the class itself wasn\u2019t really hard. Although lectures aren\u2019t required, I would definitely recommend going. She does clicker points or Hotseat like once a week, and she explains stuff better than trying to read it. HW isn\u2019t hard, just time consuming. She does this smart book thing where you have an assignment every week and the better you do, the less problems you have to do and the worse you do the more problems you have to do, along with her weekly hw assignment. However, she is a good lecturer and was pretty available when I needed her.\n\nGood luck!"}

I would say be on top of all the weekly deadlines (smartbook hw, connect hw, and weekly quizzes). It can be easy to forget about those so put them into a calendar at the beginning of the year (if you don\u2019t use the brightspace calendar like me).

Some stories are actually really funny or entertaining.\n\nMGMT 455 has been one of the best classes I've ever taken at Purdue. Just go to class to get all the lecture material, and you'll be golden. I think I probably read about 10-30 pages of textbook per week for the quizzes (easy read, though. Not like a standard textbook, and various case examples are scattered throughout the chapters) and in the end, it was an easy A.\n\nGothard is a great professor, though. I absolutely loved his class."}

Take it at a community college and that will probably make it easier as well. Don't give up on your dreams just yet. It might be that math is just something you really really struggle at. \n\nThough I will say if it is because you aren't putting in the effort then you will face much harder classes in medical school.

I would recommend trying to arrange a meeting with pre-professional advising (https://www.purdue.edu/preprofessional/?_ga=2.54666543.522369836.1673323631-587514558.1669348272).  Ask them to be honest about your chances at getting into a med school program with those failing calc grades and a C in Chem115."}

Should I still be here? | COMMENT_BODY: Let\u2019s address the root of the issue here - which part of Calculus is not jiving with you? Calc 1 is mostly just limits and derivatives right? First you learn limits as h approaches 0 blah blah blah and then you slap the function in and sub (x-h) in for all x values and whatever. That\u2019s all plug and chug. Then you learn power rule which is a godsend and super easy, then you learn chain rule which kinda sucks and then quotient rule which really sucks and then you apply it to some story problems. Is there any topic I\u2019m missing? It\u2019s been a few years.\n\nEither way, having taken it yourself a few times now, where in the course roadmap did you notice that it just wasn\u2019t clicking? Or was it clicking and you were making computational mistakes? Were exams your downfall? Homework take too long? Recitation quizzes giving hell? All 3?"}
{"code": "Ma 16010", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Failed calc 1 3 times. Should I still be here? | COMMENT_BODY: Yo Op- I was in the EXACT situation. Sorta. I failed Calc AB my junior year of HS. Actual F. Senior year got a D- and that didn't give me any credit for transfering. Luckly my GPA was a 3.9 when I graduated HS, but I came here freshman year first semseter, got a C- in MA 161 and had to retake for my major. Got it the second time, second semester of Freshman year and passed with a C.  \n\n\nLook- I'm in Computer Science. I was utterly clowned on because I couldn't even get past Calc I. I woke up every day hating myself, and feeling depressed because it was a vicious cycle of thinking I sucked at math, not putting effort  on the hw, failing on quizzes, failing on tests, and having to retake everything. It took a while, but I finally decided \"screw it, no one believes in me, not even myself. I'll give it one last shot.\"\n\nI put in the effort- every day. I made a shit ton of mistakes, even on easy stuff. I missed a question once because I thought 4 + 4 was 16. I went to office hours, even when everyone was depressed because of covid. I passed with a C. I then went on to get B's in Calc II/Calc III/Multivariable, and Linear Algebra. That kind of attitude of \"screw it, no one believes in me and it's kind of pathetic that I don't either\" got me through my major.  \n\n\nI hated programming because I felt like sucked at it compared to my peers. Got a C in CS 180 which is the BEGINNING CS class. You know what? I turned out just fine. Got an A+ in my last few CS classes at the 400 level. I worked on software development for a NASA contract, and spoke about my software in front of the US air force. I started a business selling websites and website development over the covid semester. I won hackathons, and had my name put in newsletters at conferences. I wrote code that's rolled out now to all factories of a company's North America plants. I got a decent CS job out of college- and out of 14\\~ ish people I know who started freshman year CS in my cohort, 9 of them dropped out of the CS major. I did all this in spite of my crippling fears and inferiority complex that I was surrounded by people who were smarter at math, and better at programming than I was.  \n\n\nLook- I think you get one more shot at taking a class after failing it 3 times, you have to make a case for it iirc, but it's possible. There's that saying that \"you can do anything you want to to\" but the last part which gets left out is also important- **\"but you gotta want it bad enough.\"**  \n\n\nIf med school is your dream, I'm not you- I can't weigh your chances and your situation for you. Heck I don't even know you. All I know was that for me- I wanted CS bad enough. Bad enough to put through with it for 4 years when every day till the last semester of Junior year, I was questioning whether I should drop out. I had an email ready waiting for my advisor too, that was never sent.   \n\n\nThat's just my anecdotal 2 cents. Whatever you do- even if it's not med school, you gotta ask yourself if you want it bad enough."}

I feel like a lot of the time it\u2019s crucial to finding what tricks they usually put on the exams. Beyond study tips tho Realistically, you just need to take a while to think about who you are as a student. If you think it\u2019s just calculus that trips you up and beyond that you\u2019re able to learn other topics fairly easily then maybe it\u2019s not time to stop pushing towards medicine. However, realistically failing a class three times may just mean that the rigor required for some more difficult classes may not be for you. Failing it once can be chalked up to not having enough background going into it, twice maybe a rough semester, but three times could just mean that difficult classes that have rough exams may just not be something you enjoy. And realistically there will be harder classes going forward so that level of rigor is not going away. Also consider if you want to spend all of your time doing school just to try and keep up. It surely can be hard to change course after dreaming of one job for so long; however, it may just be a sign to switch now before going into med school debt.

If you're going to do anything in STEM, you have to understand basic mathematics, so generally at least Calc I. There really is no playing to your strengths outside of that one, you have to understand the content from Calc I for almost any STEM. If you have goals that you are equally passionate about that would not require Calc I for an understanding of the material, like maybe your poli sci option, then you really may want to consider a change to that. It just simply may play better to your strengths. \n\nIf you cannot really imagine yourself being happy outside of a STEM field, then you have to get through Calc I. There's no way around it, it isn't an option. You have to do everything you can to get through it and most importantly, to actively understand it. If that means taking the summer to do Calc I here at Purdue by itself so that it is the only thing you have to think about, you need to do it. There is very little in STEM that you can do without Calc I. You will not get through your upper level chem classes or biology classes that you'll need for med without it. It is that crucial for anything with an empirical basis. \n\nIf you would like help in Calc, I am more than willing to help. I personally think that I'm pretty good at teaching the material graphically, which I find helps people who struggle with calculus understand it more clearly. I learned the basics for calculus from a physics class in high school and not in math class (although my credit is from a math class), and I actually think that has helped me understand how to teach it a little better. My DMs are open if you need/want help with Calc or career advice. Good luck"}

If your having trouble doing the pre-lab math for chem 116 I just don't think your going to be able to make this work. Calc 1 is generally not considered that hard when compared to the rest of Purdue math courses. Calc 2 and 3 are probally about double, triple, or maby even quadruple the difficulty. If you can't understand derivatives and integration calc 2 is going to absolutely murder you with getting the area under a curve and calculating the volumes of solids with line equations. It's going to be so far over your head it would be like looking up at the moon. (Well ok maybe thats a bit dramatic, but I think you probally get the point)\n\nIf your dead set on continuing, as in I could never imagine myself happy and content with doing anything else in the world, I would definitely try tutoring or even taking an exam somewhere so that someone can judge the level of math that you should be in. Because if you don't know pre-calc your going to have a really tough time with calc 1, 2, and 3. \n\nBut from one of your comments if you like political science and you have a good opportunity I would take that. Or look into other programs that don't require a heavy degree of math skills. \n\nHopefully this helps, I don't want to crush dreams here, but if you just can't do the math I honestly don't think you will ever enjoy working in a job where your required to do a lot of it.

It is completely normal and understandable to get to college, start taking classes and then after being exposed to new content realize that your skill set, interests, passions are pointing you in a direction that you didn't expect. When you decide on a career path in childhood, and you grasp on to that desire for years and years, it is easy to grow up thinking that is the correct path for your life. But the truth is that you decided on that path before you were exposed to all the options that are out there for you and before you could even understand the multitude of career paths you could take. You likely decided you wanted to be a doctor before you could even recognize your own strengths. Do you want to be a doctor because you truly see that as the career that fits your personality, strengths and interests best? Or do you want to be a doctor because you decided you wanted to be a doctor when you were just a little kid (for a good reason) and then you never really thought about anything else? \n\nYour happiness matters! Your mental health matters! Do what is best for your happiness and your well being. Do not be afraid to change your path in life if and when you are doing so for your happiness and health. \n\nIf med school is still the direction you truly want to go, perhaps you could try actually going back a step in Math before repeating calculus. Does Purdue offer a pre-calculus class? If so, I wonder if taking that might help build your knowledge and confidence enough that you could then go back to calculus 1 and not find it to be such a struggle?"}

The Purdue approach to calc 1 and 2 in terms of the math is the same as many of the departments who have math involved in calculating things, which bio is heavy on.

I am in BMHS (pre-med) and I am also in the honors college.\n\n1) HONR 19901 rarely has a textbook - if ever. There are reading a to do but they are provided. I am a mentor and will be a mentor again this year. BIOL 11000 does have a textbook but you can often buy a second hand copy or like get an ebook online. If you DM me I can help you with this. I didn\u2019t take CHM 115 so I can\u2019t comment. HSCI 101 is a class I used to TA for and this class is a bunch of guest lectures - just show up to class on time. I also didn\u2019t take MA16010. I have the textbooks I used for PSY 12000 and SOC 10000 which were the same ones they used this year, so I presume they will use them again. If you DM I can share. Additionally in myPurdue there is a \u201ctextbooks\u201d section where you can go to look at assigned textbooks. I would wait before formally purchasing any because sometimes it\u2019s just a recommended book but not required - and in that case. Don\u2019t waste your money.\n\n2) A lot of your normal classes can be made into honors courses via honors contracting. This often includes writing another paper or doing an extra assignment. I know first hand that contracting BIOL 110 and PSY 120 are extremely easy. I just had to write an extra paper and they were both on topics of my choice. Otherwise HONR 299 courses are great. They change pretty regularly but I really recommend Dean\u2019s Seminar, Learning Across Differences, etc.\n\n3) bring less than what you think you need is my biggest piece of advice. If you want to DM me what your dorm hall is, I can probably get a picture for you. I would also bring storage containers. I think a good rule of thumb that I wish I followed would be 3 storage tubes (decent size ones MAX).

I would definitely recommend looking at material beforehand just to get your brain in the \"zone\" since these classes are pretty hefty. The only classes I didn't take that you are taking are HONR 19901 and PSY 120. I heard that the honors classes aren't terrible and my friend took PSY 120 and said it was an easy A and he barely studied for it. I didn't take it since I got AP credit, but overall I've heard it's not bad at all. For BIOL 110 it's very easy if you have Sean Humphrey. He's an amazing professor, and I would recommend going to his lectures. He prepares you for exams well. Make sure you take notes and study the exam review guides since they're very similar to the actual exams. CHM 115 was difficult for me, but I also hate chemistry so I inevitably struggled. Make sure to do all the practice problems for exams and make sure you know the material well. Read the textbook and do the problems in there. The exams are known to be hard, and they are so knowing the material thoroughly is very important. Going to lecture is a necessity to succeed in the class and paying attention in labs. HSCI 101 is easy. It's mostly guest speakers. I would recommend taking notes on a computer and not hand write them since there's way too much to write it all by hand. Make sure to study for the midterm and final though since the questions are very specific to what the guests talk about on their powerpoints. Also, going to lecture is mandatory and they have a scantron for attendance so you must get there on time and you cannot leave early. MA 16010 was tough for me as well, but math isn't my strong suit. Just make sure to go to lecture and do lots and lots of practice problems and you will be fine. If you ever get lost make sure you get help because it's easy to fall behind and not understand the material since it all builds off the past unit. SOC 100 is a lot of memorization. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine. The exams are mostly just applying information to scenarios. I took it all online though so it might be different in person. \n2. I didn't live in Honors but I knew a few people who did. I will say the rooms are HUGE compared to regular double/triple rooms because the ceilings are a lot higher. Some things I would recommend getting for a dorm that I wish I knew before college were shower shoes (A MUST), enough snacks/bars (i found myself getting hungry on campus and didn't want to go back  to my room), PAPER TOWELS you run out of them faster than you think you will, don't buy dishes just get plastic utensils and paper plates trust me you won't want to do dishes, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I'm more than happy to answer them just feel free to DM me!"}

The only other HONR class worth taking after 19901 and 19902 is the HONR version of ENGL 106. However, if you have credit for that class already don\u2019t bother. I recommend contracting or taking two honors level courses (you get honors credit if there is an \u201cH\u201d at the end of the course CRN) each semester until the end of your sophomore year. Upper division classes are already difficult and professors are less likely to allow you to contract so get all those credits out of the way before you get to any 400 level courses."}

{"code": "Ma 16010", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: What should I do to prepare for my spring courses | COMMENT_BODY: MA 16010: I just finished taking this. My biggest tip is to stay on top of the homework. There is a homework set (usually between 5-12 problems) assigned after each lecture and due the evening of the next lecture (ex: Monday lecture, homework on that lecture is due Wednesday night). Homework isn't too bad, but don't fall behind. If you don't like your instructor, all of the videos from other instructors are available so you can find one that works best for you. \n\nECON 251: I had no microeconomics experience before I took this class. Kelly Blanchard is a pretty good professor. That being said, I didn't like this class. Wasn't overly interesting to me. There were a lot of topics that when I learned them, they didn't make sense and I got frustrated. As you move along in the class, though, you have to apply those topics and build on them so you practice them and they become easier to understand. So just hang in there. Homeworks have unlimited attempts, so that's a fairly easy set of points."}

I\u2019d never taken any kind of economics and ended with a high B because I didn\u2019t put it much effort (I took this and halfway through I changed to a major that this wouldn\u2019t matter for).

I feel like a lot of this class depends on who is teaching it to you. My classmates who did have previous calc experience even had a hard time with my TA (they would often catch her mistakes when she was teaching and on quizzes so I wouldn\u2019t say I had a great experience trying to learn from her) and I was lost af and still ended with a C somehow. Stay on top of the homework. It\u2019s really not much per assignment, just a lot of assignments (like 3 a week). I think vids are available from every instructor and I heard other instructors were better than mine so utilize that if need be.\n\nMGMT 200: I had Terra Maienbrook. I wasn\u2019t super interested in accounting but the class itself wasn\u2019t really hard. Although lectures aren\u2019t required, I would definitely recommend going. She does clicker points or Hotseat like once a week, and she explains stuff better than trying to read it. HW isn\u2019t hard, just time consuming. She does this smart book thing where you have an assignment every week and the better you do, the less problems you have to do and the worse you do the more problems you have to do, along with her weekly hw assignment.

ENGR 131 is a lot of busywork, and most people find calculus to be difficult. There is no reason to rush at the very beginning; engineering classes have a very linear progression and rushing doesn't really shave off any time to graduation.\n\nOn your My Purdue page under Transcript you can click View Unofficial Transcript and see what Purdue accepted as Transfer credit. If you really want to add another class, you can add on COM 114 if you still need credit for that, or some easy gen ed that will count for a later Aero requirement. Something like Micro/Macro, Sociology, or Psychology. You'll want to ask your advisor about that.\n\n> someone suggested that I take physics first semester and chem second semester. Any thoughts on that?\n\nIt doesn't matter. Everyone has their own theories about one semester having easier exams than the other. I did CHEM 115 first and Physics in the spring. First semester gen. chem. is mostly a rehash of high school chemistry, so if you did well in high school, it shouldn't be bad at all.

{"code": "Ma 16010", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: 2016 New Student Megathread | COMMENT_BODY: I'll try to help. I'm a rising senior in EE minoring in CS. From my experience, the CS minor made me stand out, since a lot of engineering involves some sort of programming now. I'm one class away and have no regrets getting the minor, but your mileage may vary. \n\nThat being said, the CS minor is going to be annoying. They just added new rules that say that you can only take CS classes in the off-semester, meaning the semester that the CS majors don't normally take it [link](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/undergraduate/curriculum/minor.html). It was a pain before they added the rule, and I imagine now it'll be tougher. You'll be taking 180 in the Spring, 182/240 in the Fall, etc. You could definitely move things around, but make sure you plan things out really well. The size of the CS department seems bigger than it could handle, so I doubt any of this will change. \n\nAnd I'll just talk about my personal opinion about the combos you listed. Feel free to get other people's experience or opinions as well.\n\n*AAE Major/ECE Minor* - I had to look up AAE stuff, and it doesn't look too bad. None of the ECE courses are required, but a bunch are technical electives or substitutes for stuff, so it should be manageable in four years. It also has the potential to be pretty useful, since AAE is competitive and the minor should help you stand out from other people. But that's just my impression; I don't actually have experience with it.\n\n*EE Major/CS Minor* - Hey, that's me! Like I said, the CS department is a pain. But certain EE fields (like DSP, Controls, Computer Engineering, and more) can have a lot to do with CS and the minor will definitely help. Pretty much none of the CS classes count for EE, so you'll be taking 16-19 credits on top of the 124 needed to graduate. It's doable with summer classes, credit coming in, or really heavy semesters. If you can fit it, go for it. And again, I found it helpful when looking for internships. And it was helpful when I got into internships as well, since I often programmed. \n\n*CmpE Major/Physics Minor* - I assume this will be the easiest. If you plan it out right, it'll be two more classes on top of the 125 credits to graduate. But I also feel like it'll be the least useful. A physics minor is pretty common and employers know that kids only get it because its an extra class or two. There's nothing wrong with getting it if you're genuinely interested, but besides showing that you're a hard worker, or that you're interested, it wouldn't help much, since Physics classes aren't relevant to a CmpE curriculum. If you can prove me wrong there, then maybe it'll be worth it.\n\nLastly, my personal philosophy on minors is that they're a lot of trouble for not very much gain. But at the same time, doing all the little things to improve your resume ever so slightly is what's going to help you get a job. Every 0.01 you raise your GPA; every club and leadership experience; every extra class or minor will do a little more to help you stand out from the thousands of other Engineering graduates looking for jobs. \n\nIf you have some questions, let me know. It definitely looks like you did some research before you posted. "}

They change the Honor's class every year, but the first year engineering class is pretty consistent. \n\n141 and 142 are pretty cool. You do a bunch of group work, which isn't too bad since most Honor's kids are reasonably hardworking. But the class does get time consuming, especially when projects are due. You learn a bunch of programming, and the rest of it is kinda pointless. \n\nYou get the Honor's dorm too. Not sure what the building itself is like yet, but having that community is really nice. Easy to make friends and stuff. "}

These are your core classes though, so you should take these both this semester, and probably take 242, 272, and 280 next semester. SOC 100 and SOC 220 are very easy for your BSS. MA 16020 is pretty hard if you don't like math from what I heard, so I just took MATH202 at IVY Tech and it was dummy easy.

I personally cannot attest to the two ENGL courses since I have not taken them, but from the looks of the class descriptions, if you enjoy learning the roots of literature, take those. Might be really interesting classes, but just not my cuppa tea. \n\nSo enter PSY 120. Personally, I think this class is the bee's knees for a gen ed. First, it was interesting. It goes into the basics of different aspects of psychology, both intangible (different approaches, what might be underlying processes) and tangible (what chemicals cause certain responses, hormones, brain structure), as well as the history of the topics that form the backbone of psychology. \n\nSecondly, it was really easy. I took it with Ward, and she does a good job at explaining the topics and the exams (in class) were fairly easy, fair, and covered the main topics of the lectures and readings (oh yeah, there was some reading required). Just study some for them and you are golden.  \n\nThe only drawback for this class was that you had to partake in 20 hours of psych research. For example, for one research I had to do a 2-hour test with those anodes stuck to my head (cool right?) and got 2 hours for it. However, you had to be quick to sign up, as the sign up space was limited, and if you wanted to do one but couldn't fit it in your schedule for any of the slots, too bad. But the research wasn't scary or anything and was pretty easy, no being locked up in a box for 5 hours.\n\nNo papers, just research and (4?) exams. Easy, breezy, beautiful. *Covergirl.* No but really, I do recommend PSY120. It's easy, fun, and interesting. *Aaaaaand* if you are interested in more psych-stuff, PSY120 can lead into PSY350 Abnormal Psych, which is also pretty intersting (but much harder).\n\nTL;DR Take PSY120."}

I've seen students who earn A-level and AP credit bomb math and science courses (either retakes of what they've already tested out of or ones the next level up).  The only real way to know is to be engineer about it . . . and measure it.   \n\nTherefore, I would suggest taking the practice exam for the Calc I or Calc II Advanced Credit exams:  [http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/undergrad/credit/sciencecalc.php](http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/undergrad/credit/sciencecalc.php).  No need to take the official exam, just the practice.  If you can pretty easily get 80% of the answers right on the practice exams, you can probably consider yourself good to go for the course and can jump into the next one.  Ditto with CHM - practice Advanced Credit exam is here: [https://www.chem.purdue.edu/academic\\_programs/testout.php](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/academic_programs/testout.php).

Everyone mentioned clothes. Yes, clothes are important. But if you are bringing your car, *please* make sure you practice driving in snow/ice in an empty parking lot. Watch youtube videos or something too. I can't tell you the number of accidents I see on the first snow day because new students have no idea how to drive around in it.\n\n3. FWIW, I was in ECE and I worked pretty hard during that time and ended up with ~3.5 GPA. I did have a bit of a social life though. I knew one guy in ME whose scholarship required him to get a 4.0, and he managed to do it, but I didn't see him at all except in the summer. His entire undergrad was locked in his room studying and doing homework. So yeah, 3.7/3.8 is more than possible, but it's going to cost you free time.\n\nJust my opinion: I'd focus more on outside activities like joining a club such as solar racing or SAE and use that to build a resume rather than focusing on the GPA. You will pick up all sorts of skills that they won't teach in class, and you'll gain lots of connections for later. And a company is not really going to care about a 0.2 GPA difference if you have practical experience, and no one after that first job is going to care about your GPA at all."}

{"code": "Ma 16500", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Advice on taking Calculus 1 or 2 as an incoming freshman who did well in AP Calculus AB? | COMMENT_BODY: Most people do find Calc 2 to be the hardest.  In Calc 2, you deal with advanced integration techniques and infinite series.  These topics require a lot of heavy logical thinking to master.\n\nCalc 3 is multivariable calculus.  You essentially go back to the \"basics\" of derivatives and integrals, but this time using more than one variable.  Calc 3 is then seen, generally, as easier, since the concepts are just generalizing your old Calc 1 and Calc 2 concepts to a slightly different setting.\n\nAs for linear algebra... It depends on your instructor.  If you take MA 265 and the instructor doesn't force you to spend a lot of time with the logic and understanding the concepts, then it could be pretty easy since you'll be mainly focusing on computation using matrices.  If your instructor expects you to actually understand the mathematics going on, then it's more difficult, for sure, but still probably a bit easier than Calc 2.  Linear algebra has a lot of algorithmic approaches that are easy to determine simply by looking at the problem, if you focus on computational aspects of it."}

The only real way to know is to be engineer about it . . . and measure it.   \n\nTherefore, I would suggest taking the practice exam for the Calc I or Calc II Advanced Credit exams:  [http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/undergrad/credit/sciencecalc.php](http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/undergrad/credit/sciencecalc.php).  No need to take the official exam, just the practice.

It is good to not be stressed and to have extra time to meet friends, go to clubs, etc. If you are trying to get an internship as a freshman, you will have a lot of work upfront in terms of doing a resume, LinkedIn, etc. CS 191 will walk you through the entire process."}

I think the biggest thing is that in college you\u2019re essentially the one in charge of making sure you\u2019ve done everything and are getting the most out of class so don\u2019t be scared to ask questions and get help.

A decent amount of quiz questions come from the code on the slides. Also, if you understand everything on the slides and homework you will be fine for the live coding midterms. The first midterm is hard. The average was in the 40-50 range. The second midterm is extremely easy, the average was around 90-100, but they might have been compensating for the first midterm. The homeworks aren't hard at all. The projects should be enough for you to understand all the content. I can't comment on the labs bc there weren't any during COVID-19. \n\nAs far as getting an internship during the school year, very few people do this. Freshman year this would be hard for you to get bc you don't have all of the foundational CS classes.

MA 261 aka Calc 3 is basically Calc 1 but with an added dimension so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about forgetting Calc 2 and just making sure your core Calc knowledge is sturdy. I think you can definitely handle this schedule plus you\u2019ll have mornings/afternoons as well as time in between classes (which you kinda didn\u2019t have in high school for example) to also do work so you\u2019d be fine, just note that courses with more credits will affect your gpa more so try to keep your grades good in them"}

The textbook is available online, but I'd actually suggest doing something like Harvard's CS50. I also know that there's something like a two week early bridge program for CS180- you might want to look into that.\n\nIf you do have previous experience, then I'd just say start skimming the 180 textbook if you want.

Even with no dual credit or community college/summer classes, students can CODO to FYE with good grades in a category 1 class (typically MA 161/165), a category 2 class (typically PHYS 172 or CHM 115), and a Category 3 class (ENGR 131, a writing class, an oral communication, or a humanities or behavioral/social science). For example, if a student with no dual/AP credits has a 3.2+ GPA in MA 161, CHM 115, and ENGL 106, then they will probably get into FYE.

You also use MATLAB to solve linear algebra problems.  (Ie. You learn the algorithm to get eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues are the answer to problem #15)\n\n351 is more of a proof-based mathematics class.  Although you do learn the same methods as in 265, you learn them in greater depth and you have to write proofs for the theorems you use. (Ie. You learn the algorithm to get eigenvalues, and proof of the algorithm to get eigenvalues is the answer to problem #15)\n\nI took both..long story, but IMO 351 was one of the most fun classes I took at Purdue.  You get a nice intuition of *why* linear algebra works, and I really think it makes later math classes that use the techniques (ie MA303) much, much easier. I also believe it is far more challenging than 265 (though not absurdly difficult).\n\n\nI would recommend 351 if you really like or want to get into proof-based, non-computational mathematics, or if you want a deeper understanding of the linear algebra that will permeate through your later studies.  However, it is a more difficult course, so if it fills the same requirements and your schedule is hard keep that in mind."}

{"code": "Ma 26600", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: This is a very standard CompE courseload. I'm EE, but I knew many people who did more or less the exact same thing as you, except EAPS 10600. It will be a lot of work, but there are really no easy semesters once you get out of FYE, regardless of your branch of engineering. My advice is to start all 20007 labs the day they are assigned, and to make sure you REALLY understand lectures in 20001 and go to office hours. I had Peroulis for a lecturer and he was a godsend, but I'm not sure if he'll be teaching in the fall, so I recommend using the textbook often for practice. 264 is a slog with Quinn whose homeworks are beastly, but I'm assuming you have Lu for the fall so the workload won't be terrible, just don't make sure you have a really good handle on debugging with gdb and valgrind. I did diffy q at a local university over the summer, so I don't know much about 266 but the general consensus seems to be that it's another Purdue math class rife with the same problems that plagued 261 and 265, so expect to put time into that one. All in all you have a very standard semester, and even though the workload might seem like a lot, you are in the same boat as 70-75% of other ECE sophomores so you'll have plenty of peers to work with and ask for help. Don't get too discouraged, because the material is actually quite interesting if you spend some time with it.\n\nNOTE: 20007 has the workload of a 3-4 credit class packed into a 1-credit class, but everything you do is absolutely fundamental to the major and really gives you a good intro to topics in 20001 and 20002. Just parcel your time well and don't hesitate to go to office hours for circuit debugging, some of the latter labs can be a grind."}
{"code": "Ma 26600", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE course load thoughts? | COMMENT_BODY: I think that\u2019s a very doable semester. You might find yourself spending the most time in 20001, 20007, and maybe 264. 264 is a bit odd and I can\u2019t definitively say much, even though I took it lol, other than do your work and if there\u2019s extra credit take it. 20007 is a lot of work for just one credit since you have a lab and a report/write-up each week and you will also have a practical and a project of some sort (basically a slightly more intense lab). 20001 should be okay if it\u2019s in person but they usually don\u2019t go heavy into application so homework/quizzes/exams can be tough. I\u2019d recommend reading the textbook from time to time and getting some sort of group together to either study or work on stuff with cause they had to implement such a system cause of how bad we did that semester and it really helped. I\u2019m taking MA 266 rn and it\u2019s pretty simple imo. Overall it is very doable but those 3 ECE classes will probably take up the most time so stay on top of deadlines for the week and don\u2019t be afraid to ask for help even if you feel stupid.

MA 265 is linear algebra (requires 261 or 27101 credit I believe), MA 266 is differential equations (requires credit in MA 261, must take after or concurrently with 265), MA 262 is a combo of 266 and 266 in one semester (cannot take if shooting for AAE, must take 265 and 266 separately), and MA 303 is partial differential equations (must take after 266).  \n\nHope this clears some Purdue Math stuff up, it can be tricky your first semester."}

{"code": "Ma 27101", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Questions from an engineering freshman | COMMENT_BODY: 1. Goss Scholars contains the programs available to Honors FYE and Do More in 4 in the past. Track 1 is the ENGR 161/162 track. In this track, the first semester you will focus a lot on basic engineering design principles, team dynamics, physics, Python, and will have three major team projects including modeling engineering systems in Python and coding and building a robot. ENGR162 will cover MATLAB, angular momentum principles, engineering control systems, big data, along with three more engineering design projects. Track 1 is definitely very rewarding and really prepares you for future courses. Track 2 is more like ENGR195 last year where it is a condensed version of track 1 where you are taught MATLAB, Python, do a few design projects, and are mostly done with your foundational FYE engineering in one semester which allows you to start taking a few more major courses earlier. You are also able to do VIP projects which are pretty cool too. This track is a bit easier, but you do not learn as much at all. If you are willing to put in a LOT of work, Track 1 is the most rewarding in my opinion. It builds a very good foundation in engineering (especially in AAE). \n2. Purdue Math is pretty brutal so I would suggest taking only one math class especially with ENGR 161/162 because how much time they take. For AAE, you will have to take 261, 265, 266, and 303 at some point. You can look at Purdue's Plan of Study for AAE to see what courses will be required. I would suggest holding off on AAE203 first semester as well. If you are looking at AAE, try taking CGT163 or CS159 instead of a math course or AAE203 because they are quite a bit easier and can help you with the basics when you hit AAE courses. \n3.

You learn alot and are better prepared for your future years. Another comment said it is unorganized. This is not the case and they do an impressive job of clarifying and making the details clear... except when they leave some details out for the projects, which is on purpose and designed to reflect the real world. They have requests for more information which is where you get these details. \n\nIf you are planning on going this route, the class looks like this: pretty beefy homeworks due early Friday morning, three projects each semester. Project 1 in each is more of an introductory/simple project. Project 3 is the main project and uses the robot kits (Legos/raspberry pis and sensors). Project 3 lasts most of the semester and is stressful but in my opinion a great experience as well. Project 2 happens during project 3 and you get class time to work on it. It involves modeling complex systems. There are also occasional in class things that are like mini-projects. That pretty much covers the assignments. You do all of these with your team, assigned at the beginning of each semester. I loved my team both semesters. \n\nThe main topics you study are physics, coding (Python and matlab), engineering and team skills, statistics, modeling systems, and documentation. The lectures are interesting and very well done. Of course some are alot less interesting, particularly after an all nighter doing a homework I procrastinated, not gonna lie haha. I had Dr. Nauman 1st semester, Dr. Whalen 2nd. They were both great. You have 3 exams, the third being the final. They are hard, study and do your best, you will be fine. They have good office hours for homework/projects and review sessions for exams. Extremely happy I decided to take 161/162."}

Most CS majors won\u2019t take an advanced class until sophomore spring at the absolute earliest. And your CS and math courses will be at most 11 credits of the 12-16 we would recommend.

As long as you pay attention in class you're pretty much good. There are quizzes every so often and a couple tests too. I can't remember if we could use our notes or not, I think we did. The one big thing about that class though was a big paper we had to do. I think it had to be about 10 pages long, ish, and it's worth a reasonable chunk. I think I got a D or something on the paper and ended up with a B in the class. I don't remember.\n\nThe section of EAPS 375 I'm in right now is kinda bullcrap. The teacher is brand new and is teaching 4 other classes at the same time. There's a group project/presentation at the end.

{"code": "Ma 30100", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Questions about taking a math course at Purdue as a high school student | COMMENT_BODY: The best advice is to talk with your counselor and an advisor in the math department.  Only they will be able to tell you for sure what you can and can't take.\n\n\nI will warn you, the math department is very strict in their pre-reqs and guidelines.  I highly doubt they will let you slip through the cracks and into MA 375.  With the math department it's \"meet the requirements or hit the road\".  For example, all incoming freshman have to take a placement test for math.  You have to have a certain score to enroll in math at Purdue.  If you miss that score, even by one point or a fraction of a point, you can't take math at Purdue.  You would have to attend Ivy Tech and get your grades up.  And in all my years as an advisor, I've never, ever known them to make an exception. \n\n\nWill you have your AP scores back by January?  Even though you have taken the classes, I'm betting the math department will want to see your AP scores before assuming you have mastered those classes.  Even though you seem like a very math smart individual, the math department can't just give you credit for a class that you didn't actually test out of.  So if you won't have AP scores by January then I doubt you will be able to take either of those classes.\n\n\nIf you won't have your AP scores and can't continue on with harder classes I would suggest taking ENGL 106 or 108.  You didn't mention taking any college english classes, and ENGL 106 is required for almost every major at Purdue.  If you can get it out of the way it will really open up your freshman schedule.  \n\n\nAs for your other question, it's much better to be cautious in your course choices.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't take hard courses.  But if you crash and burn your first year, it will be so incredibly hard to improve your GPA enough to qualify for awards, honors, and to impress companies when you search for a job.  This is part of the reason that courses have pre-reqs, to make sure that people don't get in over their heads.  So if you can't prove to the math department that you are qualified to take those courses, then they won't let you take them.\n\n\nBut really, your next step is to speak with a math undergrad advisor.  I don't know your grades or your AP scores, so I really can't tell you what you are qualified to take.  The people on here saying that you don't need the pre-req knowledge to take the course may be right, but that doesn't mean the math department won't still require you to take the pre-req class."}
{"code": "Ma 30100", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Questions about taking a math course at Purdue as a high school student | COMMENT_BODY: Neither of those classes really require any prerequisite knowledge. I loved both classes. 301 is a much different math class than what most will expect, but if you plan on going into higher core math/physics, it will give you a good taste into how you will NO LONGER see any numbers in your classes; only ideas and procedures. Discrete was more \"fun\", and could be used more for early math and physics, but mostly used in computer science classes. My recommendation would be to take the 301 if you are serious about wanting to proceed in graduate math and physics (or see if that's really what you want to get into). It is for some people, but definitely not all. However discrete will help you win money from your friends at the card tables.\n\n--honors core and applied math major 2011."}

{"code": "Ma 35100", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: MA 26500 or 35100? | COMMENT_BODY: 265 is mostly computational stuff, you learn the various methods for solving systems of linear equations with a cursory review of the proofs behind the methods.  You also use MATLAB to solve linear algebra problems.  (Ie. You learn the algorithm to get eigenvalues, and the eigenvalues are the answer to problem #15)\n\n351 is more of a proof-based mathematics class.  Although you do learn the same methods as in 265, you learn them in greater depth and you have to write proofs for the theorems you use. (Ie. You learn the algorithm to get eigenvalues, and proof of the algorithm to get eigenvalues is the answer to problem #15)\n\nI took both..long story, but IMO 351 was one of the most fun classes I took at Purdue.  You get a nice intuition of *why* linear algebra works, and I really think it makes later math classes that use the techniques (ie MA303) much, much easier. I also believe it is far more challenging than 265 (though not absurdly difficult).\n\n\nI would recommend 351 if you really like or want to get into proof-based, non-computational mathematics, or if you want a deeper understanding of the linear algebra that will permeate through your later studies.  However, it is a more difficult course, so if it fills the same requirements and your schedule is hard keep that in mind."}

That and honestly 265 would be of more help to students if it didn't emphasize calculations, since no one sits down to calculate matrices by hand, but a computer can't tell you when a particular method is valid or not. \n\n"}

{"code": "Ma 37500", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Questions about taking a math course at Purdue as a high school student | COMMENT_BODY: The best advice is to talk with your counselor and an advisor in the math department.  Only they will be able to tell you for sure what you can and can't take.\n\n\nI will warn you, the math department is very strict in their pre-reqs and guidelines.  I highly doubt they will let you slip through the cracks and into MA 375.  With the math department it's \"meet the requirements or hit the road\".  For example, all incoming freshman have to take a placement test for math.  You have to have a certain score to enroll in math at Purdue.  If you miss that score, even by one point or a fraction of a point, you can't take math at Purdue.  You would have to attend Ivy Tech and get your grades up.  And in all my years as an advisor, I've never, ever known them to make an exception. \n\n\nWill you have your AP scores back by January?  Even though you have taken the classes, I'm betting the math department will want to see your AP scores before assuming you have mastered those classes.  Even though you seem like a very math smart individual, the math department can't just give you credit for a class that you didn't actually test out of.  So if you won't have AP scores by January then I doubt you will be able to take either of those classes.\n\n\nIf you won't have your AP scores and can't continue on with harder classes I would suggest taking ENGL 106 or 108.  You didn't mention taking any college english classes, and ENGL 106 is required for almost every major at Purdue.  If you can get it out of the way it will really open up your freshman schedule.  \n\n\nAs for your other question, it's much better to be cautious in your course choices.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't take hard courses.  But if you crash and burn your first year, it will be so incredibly hard to improve your GPA enough to qualify for awards, honors, and to impress companies when you search for a job.  This is part of the reason that courses have pre-reqs, to make sure that people don't get in over their heads.  So if you can't prove to the math department that you are qualified to take those courses, then they won't let you take them.\n\n\nBut really, your next step is to speak with a math undergrad advisor.  I don't know your grades or your AP scores, so I really can't tell you what you are qualified to take.  The people on here saying that you don't need the pre-req knowledge to take the course may be right, but that doesn't mean the math department won't still require you to take the pre-req class."}

I loved both classes. 301 is a much different math class than what most will expect, but if you plan on going into higher core math/physics, it will give you a good taste into how you will NO LONGER see any numbers in your classes; only ideas and procedures. Discrete was more \"fun\", and could be used more for early math and physics, but mostly used in computer science classes. My recommendation would be to take the 301 if you are serious about wanting to proceed in graduate math and physics (or see if that's really what you want to get into).

Overall I'd say the class is more for those interested in ME than FYE students as a whole, but the main purpose of ME199 is to give you a chance to see engineering in practice, not to prepare you for whatever discipline you'd like to go into."}

Homework isn't too bad, but don't fall behind.

Kelly Blanchard is a pretty good professor. That being said, I didn't like this class. Wasn't overly interesting to me. There were a lot of topics that when I learned them, they didn't make sense and I got frustrated.

I\u2019d never taken any kind of economics and ended with a high B because I didn\u2019t put it much effort (I took this and halfway through I changed to a major that this wouldn\u2019t matter for).

I feel like a lot of this class depends on who is teaching it to you. My classmates who did have previous calc experience even had a hard time with my TA (they would often catch her mistakes when she was teaching and on quizzes so I wouldn\u2019t say I had a great experience trying to learn from her) and I was lost af and still ended with a C somehow.

I wasn\u2019t super interested in accounting but the class itself wasn\u2019t really hard. Although lectures aren\u2019t required, I would definitely recommend going. She does clicker points or Hotseat like once a week, and she explains stuff better than trying to read it. HW isn\u2019t hard, just time consuming. She does this smart book thing where you have an assignment every week and the better you do, the less problems you have to do and the worse you do the more problems you have to do, along with her weekly hw assignment.

I come from a rich family but with other siblings in college ($200k+ so all my Financial Aid is in the form of subsidized/unsubsidized loans). \n\n\nThen I got a Co-Op. Which, you're right, only makes a dent but it gives a lot more breathing room for my family so I don't have to take out private loans anymore.\n\n\nOoS Tuition is 14k for one semester. I pay for around 2k of that out of pocket from my Co-Op and I also cover all my living expenses. My financial aid is around 6k in loans. That leaves 6k for the year which is a manageable amount that my parents are able to pay off in an installment plan throughout the semester.\n\n\n\nI am also graduating \"early\" with 7 school semesters instead of 8. All in all, I'm looking to graduate with a little less than 60k in loans half of which are the private loan that covered freshman year. It's a large amount of debt but it's still within the rule of thumb that it should be less than your starting annual salary. \n\n\n\nMy advice: I'm assuming you're coming in for engineering? If not, it's definitely not worth it. If so, then I'd encourage you to look at any in-state options first. If you really are aiming for the prestige of Purdue, then I suggest you have an honest conversation with your family about the financial reality of it all: you have to be safe if you don't get a scholarship or don't get a co-op, you don't want to be paralyzed at school because your whole future rides on those things that are  not guaranteed."}

Apply for scholarships and if you feel that FAFSA does not reflect your complete financial situation, you can contact Purdue\u2019s office of financial aid and explain your situation.

{"code": "Me 37500", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Questions about taking a math course at Purdue as a high school student | COMMENT_BODY: The best advice is to talk with your counselor and an advisor in the math department.  Only they will be able to tell you for sure what you can and can't take.\n\n\nI will warn you, the math department is very strict in their pre-reqs and guidelines.  I highly doubt they will let you slip through the cracks and into MA 375.  With the math department it's \"meet the requirements or hit the road\".  For example, all incoming freshman have to take a placement test for math.  You have to have a certain score to enroll in math at Purdue.  If you miss that score, even by one point or a fraction of a point, you can't take math at Purdue.  You would have to attend Ivy Tech and get your grades up.  And in all my years as an advisor, I've never, ever known them to make an exception. \n\n\nWill you have your AP scores back by January?  Even though you have taken the classes, I'm betting the math department will want to see your AP scores before assuming you have mastered those classes.  Even though you seem like a very math smart individual, the math department can't just give you credit for a class that you didn't actually test out of.  So if you won't have AP scores by January then I doubt you will be able to take either of those classes.\n\n\nIf you won't have your AP scores and can't continue on with harder classes I would suggest taking ENGL 106 or 108.  You didn't mention taking any college english classes, and ENGL 106 is required for almost every major at Purdue.  If you can get it out of the way it will really open up your freshman schedule.  \n\n\nAs for your other question, it's much better to be cautious in your course choices.  I'm not saying that you shouldn't take hard courses.  But if you crash and burn your first year, it will be so incredibly hard to improve your GPA enough to qualify for awards, honors, and to impress companies when you search for a job.  This is part of the reason that courses have pre-reqs, to make sure that people don't get in over their heads.  So if you can't prove to the math department that you are qualified to take those courses, then they won't let you take them.\n\n\nBut really, your next step is to speak with a math undergrad advisor.  I don't know your grades or your AP scores, so I really can't tell you what you are qualified to take.  The people on here saying that you don't need the pre-req knowledge to take the course may be right, but that doesn't mean the math department won't still require you to take the pre-req class."}
{"code": "Me 37500", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Questions about taking a math course at Purdue as a high school student | COMMENT_BODY: Neither of those classes really require any prerequisite knowledge. I loved both classes. 301 is a much different math class than what most will expect, but if you plan on going into higher core math/physics, it will give you a good taste into how you will NO LONGER see any numbers in your classes; only ideas and procedures. Discrete was more \"fun\", and could be used more for early math and physics, but mostly used in computer science classes. My recommendation would be to take the 301 if you are serious about wanting to proceed in graduate math and physics (or see if that's really what you want to get into). It is for some people, but definitely not all. However discrete will help you win money from your friends at the card tables.\n\n--honors core and applied math major 2011."}

We started by proving very basic math, like 1 != 0, addition, and multiplication. Then we applied that to other parts of math.

I'm an MET who somehow managed to get an A with Lugowski teaching, although I took the class several semesters ago. \n\n* Do all the homework. This should be obvious but the homework is going to be your best study aide in the class. Don't count on him correcting your homework or showing you how to do it right. Your best bet is to find solutions for the problems online. He also takes a lot of problems from the homework and puts them on the exam.\n\n* Read the book. Another one that should be obvious but there are questions on exams that come from a minuscule detail in the reading (things like history or vocabulary).\n\n* Prepare for everything on your exams. It doesn't matter what he says is going to be on the exam, put everything you can on your cheat sheet. I remember on one mid-term he explicitly told us only content from chapters 3, 4, and 5 would be on the exam. Well it turned out half of the test was over chapter 2 and I didn't have the formulas for it on my sheet.\n\n* If you do bad on one exam don't freak out. Unless he changed the policy, your 3 mid-terms and final are weighted the same and he will drop the lowest one. I was fortunate to not have to take the final.\n\n* Do well in lab. Lab should be an easy 100% as it isn't graded too hard. Doing well in this part will help boost your overall grade tremendously.\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to ask!\n\nedit: formatting\n\n"}

Given who's teaching it (Chen, Toms, and Kaufmann), it looks like Chen or Toms is your best bet. I've never had Kaufmann, but I haven't heard great things about him. Chen and Toms are both great (Toms is hilarious and goes on funny tangents, and often lets out class early, but still gets his point across; Chen is good at teaching the material, too, but with not as many jokes). I'd check out both lecturers and see which teaching style sits better with you."}
{"code": "Phil 20800", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Is This A Good Schedule For My First Semester? | COMMENT_BODY: First off, getting straight A's is hard. Your schedule is doable, but will be a lot of work.  Calc 3 takes a LOT of time, especially if you are shooting for an A. Additionally, CS 180's projects can be tedious if you do not have a lot of experience. Also, the final project at the end of the semester in 180 will take a significant amount of time. The other 1 credit CS classes are easy. I don't know anything about the DS classes.\n\nIn my opinion, I think 17 is a lot as a first semester freshman bc you are in a completely new environment. It is good to not be stressed and to have extra time to meet friends, go to clubs, etc. If you are trying to get an internship as a freshman, you will have a lot of work upfront in terms of doing a resume, LinkedIn, etc. CS 191 will walk you through the entire process."}
{"code": "Phil 20800", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Is This A Good Schedule For My First Semester? | COMMENT_BODY: So not a cs major but I have a bunch of cs friends. 180 is gonna be tough at times and that\u2019s from an outsider\u2019s perspective and with all your classes you may have a few days or weeks where it feels like there\u2019s a lot going on but I believe it\u2019s very much doable. I think the biggest thing is that in college you\u2019re essentially the one in charge of making sure you\u2019ve done everything and are getting the most out of class so don\u2019t be scared to ask questions and get help. Office hours are gonna be a great help and try to visit your professor\u2019s office hours as well from time to time *especially* if you need help understanding something. You may find that certain strategies/lack there of to not work as well anymore so try to be flexible even if it feels scary. Lastly make sure to get to know a few people who you share classes with and study as a group cause oh man even doing homework as a group helps a lot of people learn better/quicker. Back to your schedule, make sure you\u2019ve got a planner or some sort of system and you should be good. Again, don\u2019t be scared to look like an idiot (as trust me you might feel like one in these stem majors) because at the end of the day you\u2019re learning. If you have time, you can Google these courses and find past semesters\u2019 stuff like notes, hw, exams and kinda look at that and note that people can do absolutely horrible on exams and still get good grades so don\u2019t be bummed out by your scores and stay on top of hw or other things that\u2019ll boost your grade. If it\u2019s possible I\u2019d either push MA 261 back a semester but I think your schedule is pretty good. You might end up really liking PHIL 208 cause it\u2019s like a break from your more tough or dense stuff"}

As far as studying is concerned, I would just work homework problems and old exams. Calc 3 is easy, for the most part (As long as you have a strong background for both Calc 1 and Calc 2), until you get toward the end of the course, when you start to learn certain concepts from Vector Calculus, such as Surface Integrals and Stokes' Theorem, which can be a little tricky. Calc 3 is essentially just Calc 1 and Calc 2, but in three dimensions (There are no Sequences or Series, in Calc 3, if that helps)."}

{"code": "Phil 20800", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Is This A Good Schedule For My First Semester? | COMMENT_BODY: The best tip I can recommend is to read over the PowerPoint slides several times and to make sure you understand the code that is in the slides. A decent amount of quiz questions come from the code on the slides. Also, if you understand everything on the slides and homework you will be fine for the live coding midterms. The first midterm is hard. The average was in the 40-50 range. The second midterm is extremely easy, the average was around 90-100, but they might have been compensating for the first midterm. The homeworks aren't hard at all. The projects should be enough for you to understand all the content. I can't comment on the labs bc there weren't any during COVID-19. \n\nAs far as getting an internship during the school year, very few people do this. Freshman year this would be hard for you to get bc you don't have all of the foundational CS classes. However, if you are looking for extra coding experience you could join an EPICS team or join a club. Both will give you valuable experience."}
{"code": "Phil 20800", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Is This A Good Schedule For My First Semester? | COMMENT_BODY: Studying in groups in college helps you learn things you don\u2019t understand well as well as reinforce stuff you do know by explaining it to others. It\u2019s easy to get distracted but if you don\u2019t find it super helpful then there\u2019s always other studying methods to try. I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about it now since I\u2019ve been learning that switching up your studying methods can actually help you out (if you suck at focusing that is). You really don\u2019t have to move MA 261 but it was the only course that I felt would be slightly challenging aside from CS 180. MA 261 aka Calc 3 is basically Calc 1 but with an added dimension so I wouldn\u2019t worry too much about forgetting Calc 2 and just making sure your core Calc knowledge is sturdy. I think you can definitely handle this schedule plus you\u2019ll have mornings/afternoons as well as time in between classes (which you kinda didn\u2019t have in high school for example) to also do work so you\u2019d be fine, just note that courses with more credits will affect your gpa more so try to keep your grades good in them"}

No one can guarantee that you'll get there, but yes, you can and should try your best. \n\nRegarding your question:\n\nI don't know about the 1 credit courses, but they should be fine. Ditto for the PHIL.\n\nThe main time constraints for you are MA 261 and CS 180. I'm preparing for the CS 180 test-out rn, and it's definitely a challenging course, and I have a lot of coding experience.\n\nIf you've never coded before, then you'll want to start preparing over the summer. The textbook is available online, but I'd actually suggest doing something like Harvard's CS50. I also know that there's something like a two week early bridge program for CS180- you might want to look into that.\n\nIf you do have previous experience, then I'd just say start skimming the 180 textbook if you want. I tested out of 261, but yeah, I think studying enough for it should get you there- it's a step up from Calc 1 and 2, but it won't throw you off the deep end like CS 180 without prior coding experience will."}

Just one notebook with all my class notes, don\u2019t have to worry about grabbing the right notebook on the right day for the right class. Binders can be good if you want to further organize your notes and class material, but I personally don\u2019t like lugging them around in my backpack all day. I liked to use them for keeping them at my desk and studying at home. Some classes required a lot of organization for me, so I had maybe one binder in use. Also, A lot of things are digital now. For every class, you\u2019ll have lecture powerpoints posted online, syllabi, resources, etc all online on Canvas or Blackboard (whatever you guys use now). But you can always print out the PowerPoint notes yourself if you tend to learn better by writing them down and having a physical hard copy in front of you. I liked to use a notepad for class so I could quickly jot down info as we go and then go home, pull up the PowerPoint on my computer and take notes off the PowerPoint while integrating my class notes all into my notebook. \nAnd lots of people will digitally take notes and type their class notes on a google doc and do all their notes organizing on their computer or iPad.\n\nThis is something that might take you some time to figure out and what you like best and what suits each class the best. It would be best to start off with a couple notebooks and a binder. And if you need more, you can always go back and get more."}

Evening exams are up to the professor but most are after 6pm. They may be on a different day than class, or the same day. Some professors use class time as a review session, some just cancel it (since with evening classes you have to have a class canceled to make up for it)\n\n4. I would wait to get textbooks after you receive your syllabus and the professors go through it. Sometimes the university puts \u201crequired\u201d for a textbook and it\u2019s really just optional (professors won\u2019t directly say it\u2019s optional but instead say things like \u201csupplementary reading\u201d).

My major required a lot of drawing diagrams and I hadn\u2019t quite gotten the hang on technology to be able to do that on my laptop so I just used Ole Reliable. With a standard 70 paged notebook I filled anywhere from maybe 10 pages to the whole thing depending on the class (the low end was my liberal arts classes, high end was my stem courses) of course, it also depends on handwriting size, whether you leave space to go back and annotate/write what you missed, etc. it really doesn\u2019t matter what you use to take notes as long as it works for you. As for binders, I normally only use them when I print off the lectures and take notes on the slides, or if a require textbook is loose leaf. \n\n6.

I've seen students who earn A-level and AP credit bomb math and science courses (either retakes of what they've already tested out of or ones the next level up).  The only real way to know is to be engineer about it . . . and measure it.   \n\nTherefore, I would suggest taking the practice exam for the Calc I or Calc II Advanced Credit exams:  [http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/undergrad/credit/sciencecalc.php](http://www.math.purdue.edu/academic/undergrad/credit/sciencecalc.php).  No need to take the official exam, just the practice.  If you can pretty easily get 80% of the answers right on the practice exams, you can probably consider yourself good to go for the course and can jump into the next one.  Ditto with CHM - practice Advanced Credit exam is here: [https://www.chem.purdue.edu/academic\\_programs/testout.php](https://www.chem.purdue.edu/academic_programs/testout.php).  Take the ones for CHM 115 and 116.  CHM 111 and 112 are not engineering-accepted.  PHYS does not have test out exams, so I got nothing!

Another huge component is the homework. It is very doable to get full points on every homework assignment as long as you're smart about it. You need to start working on the homework before it's due. If there are any problems you can't figure out, make sure to go to the help center or ask your TAs for help on the question before using up all of your attempts. As for the tests, obviously make sure to work through the problems on the practice exam and review the material covered in lecture and the homework. On the hand graded portion of the exams make sure to show all of your work clearly, use the correct units on everything, and make sure that you use vector notation where applicable.

If I tell you a measurement in pounds (or possibly kilograms, depending on where you're from) you will fundamentally grasp what I'm talking about. But if I say joules or pascals or hertz, some of those may not have any fundamental meaning to you. So as you encounter these units, study their definition until you actually have a feeling for what they represent. Be able to define what a Pascal is. Or what a calorie is, and why it's different from a Calorie. Because if you don't, you'll be stuck trying to do equations like you were working through an alchemy potion. \n\nFinally, pay attention to your units.

I'm going to be a senior this coming fall and will double major in physics and mathematics.  I believe I may have some helpful tips for you.\n\nTo do meaningful, relevant research in physics, you would definitely need to earn a Ph.D.  Most of the physics material one has to learn to participate in some of today's hot-button research is taught at graduate schools.  But this is doable!  Don't let this amount of schooling (which is usually six more years after Purdue) intimidate you.  If you truly are passionate about physics, spending just a couple more years at a university would be no obstacle.\n\nBut I must note that you do not have to major in physics to be accepted into a physics graduate program.  Actually, having a major in CS would be quite valuable.  Most physics students (at least at Purdue) leave with not much experience with coding and simulating.  And much of the undergraduate research opportunities here require lots of coding!  Your passion for computer science would help you stand out from the crowd.\n\nAlso, double majoring in physics and computer science is perfect for the buzzing research field called **Quantum Computing**.  I encourage you to explore the details and implications of this topic.  It is worthy to note that the Purdue Quantum Center is a wonderful and fulfilling group that has a strong focus in quantum computing.  It is known to have participating undergraduate researchers helping out in any way they can.\n\nAnd for your track to graduation, I'm sure it will work out.  I recommend talking with your advisor as well as the undergraduate physics advisor Janice Thomaz."}

Which means you need to get into a physics graduate program, which is a lot easier with a Physics major than without. You may be able to overcome having only a minor with some experience researching in a physics lab, which is always an option.\n\nSo none of the courses you listed have 344 as a prereq.

Being disappointed that you didn\u2019t do the additional advising appointment is a valid feeling. \n\nHowever I think there are also some valid alternative thoughts to consider. For example, it\u2019s likely that had you done the additional advising appointment, the classes may have still been full. Some classes are just really hard to get into. Also, take a look at how this will impact you in the long run. It seems like in a severe case you could end up taking one extra semester to graduate. While that\u2019s not ideal, it could help you spread out your major classes and result in you getting better grades with less stress. \n\nAs far as adding in electives, the minor programs at Purdue have some phenomenal classes. The dance department welcomes all skill levels including adults who have never taken any movement classes. Bowling is a class I\u2019ve heard really good things about. If you\u2019re looking for something more related to your major but with less stress, find your favorite professor and see if an independent study would be possible. \n\nYou are going to get through this!

It\u2019s an app that notifies you when there\u2019s an open spot in a class you want to take. This has saved my butt a few times!! You have to pay to keep track of multiple classes for one semester (you can keep track of one class for free), but it was worth it because I got into the classes I wanted.

{"code": "Phys 32200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: ECE incoming Junior - Open Registration and now I'm REALLY screwed | COMMENT_BODY: Don't worry it's definitely not all lost, there is plenty of stuff you can still take. For example, you can still take ECE 302 and finish up some of your core. You can also as you said take ECE 369 (discrete math) to finish up more core. There are also still plenty of electives you can take. If you are interested in software you can take ECE 39595 (new version of 30862) which is Object-Oriented Programming in C++ or Java (two separate courses). If you like hardware, you can take ECE 337. These are just a few options.\n\nI am confused though as to why you want to take ECE 364 AND ECE 20875. If you are still on the old curriculum, then ECE 364 is what you need and frankly 20875 will not teach you much about python compared to 364, and the additional data science stuff is not that useful IMO. If you are on the new curriculum, then you have to do 20875 which will teach you python and data science (as the name says) but I think the extra effort of taking may not be worth since 364 is a time commitment and you can get more Python experience yourself because 20875 gives you the foundations. If you want to be a proficient Python then take both but this is just my opinion.\n\nHope this helps!"}

I really enjoy EAPS classes so I'm inclined to recommend EAPS 301. The content is pretty interesting, and the professor (james ogg) is super cool. As long as you pay attention in class you're pretty much good. There are quizzes every so often and a couple tests too. I can't remember if we could use our notes or not, I think we did. The one big thing about that class though was a big paper we had to do. I think it had to be about 10 pages long, ish, and it's worth a reasonable chunk. I think I got a D or something on the paper and ended up with a B in the class. I don't remember.\n\nThe section of EAPS 375 I'm in right now is kinda bullcrap. The teacher is brand new and is teaching 4 other classes at the same time. There's a group project/presentation at the end. I mean truthfully it doesn't seem all that bad, I just hate giving presentations and having group projects. I figured it would be some old guy lecturing and you'd be ok if you just paid attention.\n\nAnyway, I think either of those are good choice if you have any interest in oil and/or energy in the history and today and the future.

IMO, 25501 is extremely easy, but poorly run. 270 is hard, but poorly run. These are your core classes though, so you should take these both this semester, and probably take 242, 272, and 280 next semester. SOC 100 and SOC 220 are very easy for your BSS. MA 16020 is pretty hard if you don't like math from what I heard, so I just took MATH202 at IVY Tech and it was dummy easy.

See what score Purdue needs for you to get credit for 101, 102, and 201 and study up so you can ideally get your whole foreign language requirement done through CLEP. \n\nLong answer: \nHonestly, you aren\u2019t going to be able to take the advanced level CS classes until after you pass CS 251 anyway. Most CS majors won\u2019t take an advanced class until sophomore spring at the absolute earliest. And your CS and math courses will be at most 11 credits of the 12-16 we would recommend. So you\u2019re going to need to be taking some non-technical courses anyway."}

If you REALLY need to study over the summer I would brush up on calculus as that will likely be your hardest class for a while.\n2. Honors contracting courses is really nice because you take a class you have to take anyway and get honors credit for it. If you really want to do an honors class they aren't the worst. Just pick one you like the subject material. If you want to squeeze in some extra credit go on one of the fall break trips. You lose fall break but it's an easy credit.\n3. It's going to be small.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: Hi! I am in BMHS (pre-med) and I am also in the honors college.\n\n1) HONR 19901 rarely has a textbook - if ever. There are reading a to do but they are provided. I am a mentor and will be a mentor again this year. BIOL 11000 does have a textbook but you can often buy a second hand copy or like get an ebook online. If you DM me I can help you with this. I didn\u2019t take CHM 115 so I can\u2019t comment. HSCI 101 is a class I used to TA for and this class is a bunch of guest lectures - just show up to class on time. I also didn\u2019t take MA16010. I have the textbooks I used for PSY 12000 and SOC 10000 which were the same ones they used this year, so I presume they will use them again. If you DM I can share. Additionally in myPurdue there is a \u201ctextbooks\u201d section where you can go to look at assigned textbooks. I would wait before formally purchasing any because sometimes it\u2019s just a recommended book but not required - and in that case. Don\u2019t waste your money.\n\n2) A lot of your normal classes can be made into honors courses via honors contracting. This often includes writing another paper or doing an extra assignment. I know first hand that contracting BIOL 110 and PSY 120 are extremely easy. I just had to write an extra paper and they were both on topics of my choice. Otherwise HONR 299 courses are great. They change pretty regularly but I really recommend Dean\u2019s Seminar, Learning Across Differences, etc.\n\n3) bring less than what you think you need is my biggest piece of advice. If you want to DM me what your dorm hall is, I can probably get a picture for you. I would also bring storage containers. I think a good rule of thumb that I wish I followed would be 3 storage tubes (decent size ones MAX). One for winter stuff, one for summer/spring/formal stuff (it\u2019s not warm that long anyway), and one for bedding/personal items!\n\nFeel free to ask me anymore questions.

Any upperclassman in BMHS (pre-med concentration) Honors College willing to answer them please let me know! | COMMENT_BODY: I wasn't in the honors college, but I am majoring in BMHS and I was a freshman last semester and I took a lot of the same classes you are going to take!\n\n1. I would definitely recommend looking at material beforehand just to get your brain in the \"zone\" since these classes are pretty hefty. The only classes I didn't take that you are taking are HONR 19901 and PSY 120. I heard that the honors classes aren't terrible and my friend took PSY 120 and said it was an easy A and he barely studied for it. I didn't take it since I got AP credit, but overall I've heard it's not bad at all. For BIOL 110 it's very easy if you have Sean Humphrey. He's an amazing professor, and I would recommend going to his lectures. He prepares you for exams well. Make sure you take notes and study the exam review guides since they're very similar to the actual exams. CHM 115 was difficult for me, but I also hate chemistry so I inevitably struggled. Make sure to do all the practice problems for exams and make sure you know the material well. Read the textbook and do the problems in there. The exams are known to be hard, and they are so knowing the material thoroughly is very important. Going to lecture is a necessity to succeed in the class and paying attention in labs. HSCI 101 is easy. It's mostly guest speakers. I would recommend taking notes on a computer and not hand write them since there's way too much to write it all by hand. Make sure to study for the midterm and final though since the questions are very specific to what the guests talk about on their powerpoints. Also, going to lecture is mandatory and they have a scantron for attendance so you must get there on time and you cannot leave early. MA 16010 was tough for me as well, but math isn't my strong suit. Just make sure to go to lecture and do lots and lots of practice problems and you will be fine. If you ever get lost make sure you get help because it's easy to fall behind and not understand the material since it all builds off the past unit. SOC 100 is a lot of memorization. Just read the textbook and you'll be fine. The exams are mostly just applying information to scenarios. I took it all online though so it might be different in person. \n2. I didn't live in Honors but I knew a few people who did. I will say the rooms are HUGE compared to regular double/triple rooms because the ceilings are a lot higher. Some things I would recommend getting for a dorm that I wish I knew before college were shower shoes (A MUST), enough snacks/bars (i found myself getting hungry on campus and didn't want to go back  to my room), PAPER TOWELS you run out of them faster than you think you will, don't buy dishes just get plastic utensils and paper plates trust me you won't want to do dishes, etc.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions I'm more than happy to answer them just feel free to DM me!"}

The only other HONR class worth taking after 19901 and 19902 is the HONR version of ENGL 106. However, if you have credit for that class already don\u2019t bother. I recommend contracting or taking two honors level courses (you get honors credit if there is an \u201cH\u201d at the end of the course CRN) each semester until the end of your sophomore year. Upper division classes are already difficult and professors are less likely to allow you to contract so get all those credits out of the way before you get to any 400 level courses."}

Studied maybe 2-4 hours in advance before an exam. Quizzes and homework were easy. I got out of here with an A-. I could have done better, but frankly I just didn't enjoy the material that much.\n\nEAPS 104 - This class was one I found interesting. It's an Oceanography course. It required a decent amount of time, but not much at all. Maybe like 5-6 hours a week during an 8-week session. Quizzes required Respondus (a program that makes sure you don't cheat, records you, etc.), so it did require some studying. Projects and homework were pretty easy. It had an optional final depending on your grades. I got an A and didn't have to take the final.\n\nPOL 101 - I'm not sure if this was just my professor or the class itself, but I spent maybe 9 or 10 hours on this class total during the semester and got a 99%. A few presentations (narrated slideshows where you basically just repeat the information from lectures. I pretty much just copied the lecture slides), a few exams (multiple choice questions were from the quizzes, 3 short essay questions), and then a quiz every week or two (The quizzes allowed you to take them as many times as needed, and these questions would then be on the exams).

(took ENGR 131/195 and COM 114)\nIt let me add a minor and will probably still graduate early. If you're coming in with a lot of AP/IB credit the classes you take can put you ahead a little so you can graduate early, take fewer classes per semester or add a minor\n\nThe classes you would want to take depends on your major and the credits you will have coming in. You can use the [catalog](http://catalog.purdue.edu/) to find your major and look up courses or use the what if section of mypurdueplan. \n\nCOM 114 was really easy over the summer, and I've taken EAPS 120 online in the fall, which was also really easy. Just make sure that the classes you take fulfill a requirement for your major so you don't end up wasting a whole bunch of money."}

IMO, 25501 is extremely easy, but poorly run. 270 is hard, but poorly run. These are your core classes though, so you should take these both this semester, and probably take 242, 272, and 280 next semester. SOC 100 and SOC 220 are very easy for your BSS. MA 16020 is pretty hard if you don't like math from what I heard, so I just took MATH202 at IVY Tech and it was dummy easy. MGMT200 was easy, but more time consuming than TLI112, which was dummy easy. Overall, this would be an absolutely doable schedule."}

That being said, I don't know how the process works now as I did it before COVID.\n\nI might be in the minority here, but I enjoyed CS 182 and CS 240. The material was somewhat interesting and the professors seemed pretty knowledgeable. I do have some experience with CS though, so if you're more of a beginner these classes might be harder. The worst part of CS 182 for me was that it was an early morning class and pretty far away as well, so I ended up skipping class a lot and watching the pre-recorded lectures online instead, especially in the winter. If CS 182 is in person next semester, I would definitely recommend taking the bus in the winter though."}

See what score Purdue needs for you to get credit for 101, 102, and 201 and study up so you can ideally get your whole foreign language requirement done through CLEP. \n\nLong answer: \nHonestly, you aren\u2019t going to be able to take the advanced level CS classes until after you pass CS 251 anyway. Most CS majors won\u2019t take an advanced class until sophomore spring at the absolute earliest. And your CS and math courses will be at most 11 credits of the 12-16 we would recommend.

Lyutikov is teaching PHYS 570O: Order of Magnitude Estimation, a class where he teaches you how to estimate within an order of magnitude for a bunch of silly problems. I havent taken the class before but Lyutikov is pretty good because he likes to steer clear of heavy math and gives take home exams that you\u2019re allowed to collaborate on.

There\u2019s 4 exams and no final and he gives you a study guide for each exam that you can use on the exam. It\u2019s almost a guaranteed A and I\u2019m pretty sure it still has spots open."}

{"code": "Tli 20000", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: I need opinions on classes I'm taking next semester! | COMMENT_BODY: Hey! I am a CIT major, I think that this is a pretty well balanced schedule. IMO, 25501 is extremely easy, but poorly run. 270 is hard, but poorly run. These are your core classes though, so you should take these both this semester, and probably take 242, 272, and 280 next semester. SOC 100 and SOC 220 are very easy for your BSS. MA 16020 is pretty hard if you don't like math from what I heard, so I just took MATH202 at IVY Tech and it was dummy easy. MGMT200 was easy, but more time consuming than TLI112, which was dummy easy. Overall, this would be an absolutely doable schedule."}

I think 270 would probably give you the most trouble, but that's only if you're not careful with managing your time for lab work. If you're doing a CIT general or Cyber, TLI112 is really easy, and so is ECON210 (If your advisor lets you take it)."}

{"code": "Tdm 30200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Scheduling Advice (CompE) | COMMENT_BODY: I can comment about SET as I am the TA for the class right now. First, you will be working a lot for the 1 credit. The workload is more like a 3-credit course, but the things you'll learn are super useful if you want to pursue a career in SWE. The class starts off doing basic scripting in Python, bash, and Node.js, REST APIs using Python Flask, a little bit of SQL (both query-driven and ORM using SQLAlchemy), and ending off with cloud computing using Google Cloud.\n\nI took this class before my SWE internship this summer, and it has helped me a lot with understanding new concepts and frameworks as well as understanding more about cloud computing in my line of work."}
{"code": "Tdm 30200", "chunk": "POST_TITLE: Scheduling Advice (CompE) | COMMENT_BODY: I had a very similar schedule (but without 395 and with 301 instead of 302). It wasn't terrible but was a lot of work. 368 and 362 were fun, but they both have heavy work loads. Time management will be essential since some 368 programming assignments took a lot of time (15+ hours). \n\nTaking 4 ECE classes and a TA position is probably a bit much though."}
